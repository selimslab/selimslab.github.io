now it seems to me that capability info is just some specific metadata for MDSF  analytics item. And deploying the artifacts in sequence is just creating items (and of course defining the new item types) the metadata store is more than enough for this so why do i try to push things, let's go and write it 

the point is not who will let me but who will stop me?


you are already trying to understand things, a relax mind will do it quicker but if you stress yourself out, you'll only hinder yourself further 

store in lakehouse or what, because the storage client must write the file to somewhere, why not fabric lakehouse

then where does the item metadata is written 

i think the main help of the sdk is providing the fabric client, all else could be done here as well 

when creating the data solution item, FE calls the ms-fabric workload client, and this FE library implements the Fabric client, there is no such counterpart in BE, so it needs a client for sure 

BE has already a mechanism to store metadata, and it can store files in lakehouse, 

so the main choice is either moving the fabric client from sdk to the sample, and to do rest without having to deal with its BS, or the second choice is to adapt to SDK 

but when you take the client, the models come with it too 

so the way is to adapt 


FE createItem()
ms-fabric wl client 
fabric 
BE createItem 
MDSF instance 
store metadata 

FE list capabilities 
for this we don't need files 


so when FabricClient calls Fabric with create item , will Fabric call WL BE, then I must define all the artifact types anyway 




ok how do you create an artifact 

BE 
deploy capability
get manifest
capDepEngine create 
deploy artifacts 
capArtEng create artifact 
call fabric api and get created item 


If lakehouse stores in onelake, then it doesn't work yet
