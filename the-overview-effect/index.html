  <p>From <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/william-shatner-space-boldly-go-excerpt-1235395113/">https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/william-shatner-space-boldly-go-excerpt-1235395113/</a></p>

<p>So, I went to space.</p>

<p>The countdown began. With all the attending noise, fire, and fury, we lifted off. I could see Earth disappearing. As we ascended, I was at once aware of pressure. Gravitational forces pulling at me. The g‚Äôs. There was an instrument that told us how many g‚Äôs we were experiencing. At two g‚Äôs, I tried to raise my arm, and could barely do so. At three g‚Äôs, I felt my face being pushed down into my seat. I don‚Äôt know how much more of this I can take, I thought. Will I pass out? Will my face melt into a pile of mush? How many g‚Äôs can my ninety-year-old body handle?</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, relief. No g‚Äôs. Zero. Weightlessness. We were floating.</p>

<p>We got out of our harnesses and began to float around. The other folks went straight into somersaults and enjoying all the effects of weightlessness. I wanted no part in that. I wanted, needed to get to the window as quickly as possible to see what was out there.</p>

<p>I looked down and I could see the hole that our spaceship had punched in the thin, blue-tinged layer of oxygen around Earth. It was as if there was a wake trailing behind where we had just been, and just as soon as I‚Äôd noticed it, it disappeared.</p>

<p>I continued my self-guided tour and turned my head to face the other direction, to stare into space. I love the mystery of the universe. I love all the questions that have come to us over thousands of years of exploration and hypotheses. Stars exploding years ago, their light traveling to us years later; black holes absorbing energy; satellites showing us entire galaxies in areas thought to be devoid of matter entirely‚Ä¶ all of that has thrilled me for years‚Ä¶ but when I looked in the opposite direction, into space, there was no mystery, no majestic awe to behold . . . all I saw was death.</p>

<p>I saw a cold, dark, black emptiness. It was unlike any blackness you can see or feel on Earth. It was deep, enveloping, all-encompassing. I turned back toward the light of home. I could see the curvature of Earth, the beige of the desert, the white of the clouds and the blue of the sky. It was life. Nurturing, sustaining, life. Mother Earth. Gaia. And I was leaving her.</p>

<p>Everything I had thought was wrong. Everything I had expected to see was wrong.</p>

<p>I had thought that going into space would be the ultimate catharsis of that connection I had been looking for between all living things‚Äîthat being up there would be the next beautiful step to understanding the harmony of the universe. In the film ‚ÄúContact,‚Äù when Jodie Foster‚Äôs character goes to space and looks out into the heavens, she lets out an astonished whisper, ‚ÄúThey should‚Äôve sent a poet.‚Äù I had a different experience, because I discovered that the beauty isn‚Äôt out there, it‚Äôs down here, with all of us. Leaving that behind made my connection to our tiny planet even more profound.</p>

<p>It was among the strongest feelings of grief I have ever encountered. The contrast between the vicious coldness of space and the warm nurturing of Earth below filled me with overwhelming sadness. Every day, we are confronted with the knowledge of further destruction of Earth at our hands: the extinction of animal species, of flora and fauna . . . things that took five billion years to evolve, and suddenly we will never see them again because of the interference of mankind. It filled me with dread. My trip to space was supposed to be a celebration; instead, it felt like a funeral.</p>

<p>I learned later that I was not alone in this feeling. It is called the ‚ÄúOverview Effect‚Äù and is not uncommon among astronauts, including Yuri Gagarin, Michael Collins, Sally Ride, and many others. Essentially, when someone travels to space and views Earth from orbit, a sense of the planet‚Äôs fragility takes hold in an ineffable, instinctive manner. Author Frank White first coined the term in 1987: ‚ÄúThere are no borders or boundaries on our planet except those that we create in our minds or through human behaviors. All the ideas and concepts that divide us when we are on the surface begin to fade from orbit and the moon. The result is a shift in worldview, and in identity.‚Äù</p>

<p>It can change the way we look at the planet but also other things like countries, ethnicities, religions; it can prompt an instant reevaluation of our shared harmony and a shift in focus to all the wonderful things we have in common instead of what makes us different. It reinforced tenfold my own view on the power of our beautiful, mysterious collective human entanglement, and eventually, it returned a feeling of hope to my heart. In this insignificance we share, we have one gift that other species perhaps do not: we are aware‚Äînot only of our insignificance, but the grandeur around us that makes us insignificant. That allows us perhaps a chance to rededicate ourselves to our planet, to each other, to life and love all around us. If we seize that chance.</p>
