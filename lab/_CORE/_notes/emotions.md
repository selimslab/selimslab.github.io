Like weather 

Like signals 

It's how I look, eyes don't see, brain sees

Anger: assertion, firm but calm  

Annoyance: curiosity 

Anxiety: hope 

Arrogance: really?

Love should be remade every day, like fresh bread 

Happiness looks small while you hold it in your hands 

Conceal a flaw and the world will imagine the worst
