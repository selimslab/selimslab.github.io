## Cognitive Biases
- Why do I think this way or that?
- What do I really feel?
- Do I really listen?
- Do I see things as they are?
- Do I distort things in my mind?

## Bias for unhappiness
- Exaggerating negatives
- Ignoring positives
- Expectation
- Taking it personal
- Mind reading, jumping to conclusions


## critical thinking

There are many ways to interpret reality 

Uncertainty

Probability

Relativity

Open-ended questions 

Suspend judgment 

Look below the surface 

"Delete the adjectives and you will have the facts."


## systems thinking

Simple parts create complex systems

Before a complexity threshold, there is convergence. For example, 
- Organic molecules converge to a finite number of possible stable states, proteins 
- Plants and animals in a desert end up with a small set of strategies to survive

After the threshold, a system enters into the land of chaos. A minor change can create enormous differences. There is no balance point to arrive  

## learning 

Do I admit that I don't know?

Do I follow my genuine interest?

Do I put in effortful practice? 

Spaced repetition

Surprise 


## decisions 

Can I prevent a problem before it happens?

How do I look at it? Can I try a new perspective? What do I see? 

Should I say it? in this tone? with these words? 

Am I promising anything? Can I make it more clear to prevent misunderstandings?

What is the due diligence for this decision? How much is enough, how much is too little or too much?

What are the criticial factors? What to focus on here?

How do the probabilities look here?

Am I chasing pleasure? Am I avoiding necessary pain? 

Am I exaggerating in my head? 

Do I feel comfortable? Am I hungry, tired, thirsty, sleepy, or in a bad mood? 

Can I cut the rope?

How to win without fighting?

Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished

How realistic is to expect perfect decisions? As long as I follow a reasonable process, do I have anything to worry about?

How would I feel about this decision in a day? in a week, month, year? 

Read, write, discuss, question


## problem solving 

How can I define it well? 

What are my assumptions? What are the constraints? 

How can model the problem? What are inputs, outputs, and system dynamics? 

What are the examples? Can I derive new examples? 

What questions can help?
