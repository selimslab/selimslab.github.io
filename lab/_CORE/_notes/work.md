## what to work on 

Do I give my body and mind a fighting chance? Do I relax and enjoy life enough? 

Do I follow my genuine interest? 

How do I feel about my direction? Going fast in a wrong way? 

Is this the most important thing I should be working on?

What is fun to me but work for others? What makes me lose track of time? 

What comes naturally to me? What blurs the line between work and play?

Am I playing a game where odds are in my favor? What are my limitations? 

Do I like the process or the idea of results?

What would my best version do? 

---

We are complicit in what our employers do. Would I work for people I don't respect?

Do I stay humble? Is it humility or short-selling myself? 

Do I try to hide my flaws? Conceal a thing, and the world imagines the worst 

Am I forming healthy relationships with people?

There is more outside the beaten path, I can chart my own course 

Do I own what I am working on? Can I show it? Do people see me doing it? Do my work built any lasting capital, whether skills, reputation, or social connections?

My decline is coming sooner than I think 



## wealth 
- Ignore status games 
- Play long-term games with long-term people
- Take strategic business risks
- Leverage capital, code/media, and talent 


## nameless 

No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.

## get it done 

**What is the next action?**

What is my top goal today?

How to break it down?

What's one little thing to get me started?

Can I eliminate? delegate? batch? timebox? 


## Tactics 
- checklists
- checkpoints
- write  
- draw  
- end it with a cliffhanger 
- do mini tasks right away
- save some easy tasks for low-motivation periods
- early morning, fresh mind
- Ignore sunk costs
- Work short, focused intervals and rest


## ideas 

Make it work but also make it beautiful

Do nothing against your will, nor against community, nor without due examination, nor with reluctancy

Half doing is an expensive way of not doing

Prevention is the best cure

Nature doesn't hurry, yet everything is accomplished

Anything that just costs money is cheap

Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple

Good is better than perfect

Walk slowly but walk

Life is what happens when you're not looking at a screen

Don't bother to impress anyone, impress yourself

Look below the surface

Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason

The work is forgotten, kindness and love remains

Do what you feel in your heart to be right, you'll be criticized anyway

It is foolish to answer a question that you do not understand. It is sad to work for an end that you do not desire.

Computers are useless. They can only give you answers - Picasso

Pursue a path you can walk with love and reverence

How would your best version handle this?

Success is being free

Success is not final, failure is not fatal, keep going

The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it

Set aside your opinion, listen with a beginner's mind

Context is worth 80 IQ points

Focus on what is important

Go take a walk

Grinding your wheels won't solve your problem

Confidence is ignorance. If you're feeling cocky, it's because there's something you don't know

Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference

Is this the most important thing I could work on?

Take the best and spread it around

Short cuts make long delays

What would your best version do?

Finish each day and leave the old nonsense behind. Tomorrow is a new day

It has to be simple to be reliable

Stupidity is not ignorance, it is using the wrong mental model

If you are making mistakes...you're Doing Something

The first draft of anything is shit

You don't have to get everything right. Define the few that must be right, and let go of the rest

What are the most important problems in your field, and why are you not working on them?

One step is enough to get started

What are my limitations?

Of course motivation is not permanent. But then, neither is bathing

A problem well stated is a problem half-solved

Being busy is wasting time

I don't know enough about this to have an opinion

The power of the unaided mind is highly overrated

The one chasing two rabbits, catches neither

Predicting the future is overrated

Simple rules lead to complex behavior, complex rules lead to stupid behavior
