What I choose is who I become 

The times and culture affects me yet I still have choice 

I can make the best of my circumstance 

Even in prison, illness, and death, I can choose my attitude 

Nature is balancing, I can observe it
- It doesn't make long speeches, it doesn't go on and on, why must I?
- It does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished

I choose to be a friend to myself and others 

It's not personal, I don't have to react 

I already have 99% what I can have. Why chase 1%? 

Best things are free 

The price is my time and life 

I can complain or appreciate 

I can live life as a game 

I can choose when to stop 

I can do one bit at a time, walk slowly but walk

This will pass too 

Silver arrows, golden silence 

I am a child of nature like trees and stars

There is only one day: today

I choose to let it go and move on 

Look at it, see the things as they are 

I will stand up for what I believe, it makes enemies but it's fine
