## Replics 

Don't panic

Wars not make one great

Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter

I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle

And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you

Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer

Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not

It's impossible.  
No, it's necessary

Outta order? I'll show you outta order!

Do. Or do not. There is no try

Fear leads to anger  
Anger leads to hate  
Hate leads to suffering

Suit up!

Fear is the mind-killer

Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is

What does your heart tell you?

May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out

So it begins

The future is not written yet  
It depends on what you do today
