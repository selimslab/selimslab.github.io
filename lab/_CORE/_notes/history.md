## agriculture

Was agriculture really a step forward for humanity? 
- Hunter-gatherers had diverse diets and a lot of free time  
- They were physically active and fit like olympic athletes
- They had superb survival skills and a deep connection to nature 

Us vs them is like free animals vs farm animals
