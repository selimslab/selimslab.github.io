## Obs. 

OpenTelemetry → Prometheus (metrics) + Loki (logs) + Jaeger (traces) → Grafana (visualization)

loki compresses logs, indexes tags only. grep only. no full text search 


Percentiles can't be aggregated 


## SRE

Observe   
Simulate   
Measure in terms of user  
Postmortems   
Progressive rollouts   

For high stake cases:
- slow and steady 
- human oversight 
- multiple checks and balances
