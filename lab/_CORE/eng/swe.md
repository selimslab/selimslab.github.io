## code review 

Be kind and respectful. Give credit where its due 
1. Easy to understand?  
2. Correct? Tested? 
3. Secure? 
4. Efficient?
5. Maintainable?

## Joel test

1. Do you use source control?
2. Can you make a build in one step?
3. Do you make daily builds?
4. Do you have a bug database?
5. Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
6. Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
7. Do you have a spec?
8. Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
9. Do you use the best tools money can buy?
10. Do you have testers?
11. Do new candidates write code during their interview?
12. Do you do hallway usability testing?

It's easy to be different, because others are mostly doing the opposite: tons of crap.

Boring tech has less risk of unknown unknowns

## hacker laws 

All models are wrong, but some are useful

Keep it simple 

Don't take down a fence unless you know why it is put up

Anything that can go wrong will go wrong
