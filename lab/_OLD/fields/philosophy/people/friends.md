"Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.”
― C.S. Lewis, The Four Loves

"When you stop expecting people to be perfect, you can like them for who they are.”

"If you have two friends in your lifetime, you're lucky. If you have one good friend, you're more than lucky.”
