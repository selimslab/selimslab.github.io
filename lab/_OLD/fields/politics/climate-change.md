Planet Earth was here long before us, it'll be here long after us. 

Human actions are trivial for the planet, even if humanity went extinct with a nuclear war, there'd be few traces left in a few thousand years, which is like a few minutes for the planet. (see [[timelines]]) 

It's possible to protect oceans, forests, mountains, and the life on earth. Nature will heal itself when we stop our abuse. 

We must pressure politicians and corporations. No effort is too small, every little action will inspire more people
