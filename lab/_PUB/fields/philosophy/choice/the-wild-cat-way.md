Take care of your body and mind 

Deep breath, watch, decide, act

Get all the help you can	

Do or do not, say or say not, speak loud and clear	
	
Behave like a pro

Start chats 	

Arguments are a waste of time 

Don’t beat yourself up

Compare today-self to yesterday-self only

Let it go, it’s not about you, it doesn’t matter
	
Spend more time outside

Take more time off, recharge, take trips on weekends

Take it easy, don’t sweat it
