Design is really an act of communication, which means having a deep understanding of the person with whom the designer is communicating.

Leverage the constraints 

Make things visible

Be mindful of emotions

Good ideas are in plain sight. They are about reordering, connecting, and right timing

Good design is respectful to your time and energy 
- It is easy to figure out even in an emergency. If you can, use what people are already familiar with
- It is generous, if you make a mistake, it has a sensible response 

Choose a specific audience and design for them 
- You can't make everyone happy. If you try, it'll make everyone unhappy. 

Test early and often
- Find five people down the hall and test in a real setting. 
- Do it three times and you'll find most of the problems with your design. 

Release early, release often. Usage is like oxygen for ideas 

Take hints from the past
- Ask your users about specific problems in the past and their approach

Design can be evil [[hijacked-minds]]

"What makes something simple or complex? It's not the number of dials or controls or how many features it has: It is whether the person using the device has a good conceptual model of how it operates." Don Norman
