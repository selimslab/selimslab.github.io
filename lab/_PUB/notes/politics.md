Happy slaves are the bitterest enemy of freedom

The world owes you nothing. It was here first

Reality doesn't go away when you stop believing in it

No good deed goes unpunished

Resist much, obey little

Any fool can make a rule, any fool will mind it

The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it

The price of freedom is dear yet it's worth it

Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent

The point is, who will stop me?

Still waters run deep

Don't let the bastards grind you down

Two may keep a secret, if one of them is dead

If you know when to stop, you are in no danger
