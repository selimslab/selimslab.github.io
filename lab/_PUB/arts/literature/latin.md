Acta, non verba 

In dubio, abstine

Qui rogat, non errat.
"(One) who asks, doesn't err.”

Ignavum fortuna repugnat 

Quod nocet, saepe docet "That which harms, often teaches.”

Innumeras curas secum adferunt liberi. - Children bring with them countless troubles.

Memento mori 

In nocte consilium, take counsel of one's pillow.

Non quia difficilia sunt non audemus, sed quia non audemus, difficilia sunt. - "It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, but because we do not dare, things are difficult."

Non semper erit aestas, It will not always be summer

Praestat cautela quam medela. Prevention is the best cure 

"He who has much desires more." (Seneca)

Semper tyrannis

Sic infit: So it begins 

Sic vita est: such is life 

"Ars longa, vita brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile."

"Life is short, craft long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment difficult."

Sapere aude, dare to know 

Solvitur ambulando, its solved by walking 

A healthy mind is worth a kingdom 

Si vis pacem, para bellum.

Give neither salt nor counsel till you are asked for it.

Veritas odium paret  Truth creates hatred

It is bad advice because it cannot be changed

Mali principii malus finis.

Intemperans adulescentia effetum corpus tradit senectuti.

Innumeras curas secum adferunt liberi.  Countless cares come with children

A good name is better than great riches.

Memento mori.

Much ado about nothing.

The world desires to be deceived; therefore it is

Ne quid nimis nothing in excess

Nothing too much

Who has not served cannot command.

Don't expect anyone to change his ways by scolding. Lead by example 

Things are difficult because we do not dare 

It will not always be summer.

When in doubt, watch and reason. There is danger in delay, too

The eye looks but it is the mind that sees

Good swimmers are often drowned

Punishment is lame, but it comes

New brooms sweep clean

Like king, like people

You get what you pay for

Quantum satis "As much as needed."

Fortune favors the bold 

He who is not ready today, will be less so tomorrow.

Qui non proficit, deficit.

Qui rogat, non errat. who asks, doesn't err

Qui scribit, bis legit , who writes, reads twice

Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? "Who watches the watchmen?"

"That which harms, often teaches.”

Opportunity knocks only once.

Stick to the subject and the words will follow.

Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law.

Men talk only to conceal the mind.

Go with the flow
