Find how real global systems are designed. 
Compare options. Be explicit with rationales. Be specific and precise. 
Reason about: 
1. Database architecture. Consider:
- data characteristics, read/write patterns
- Internal data layout and indexes (B-tree, LSM-tree, R-tree, etc.)
- Data model: only key fields, relations, indexes 
- Data flow
- ACID, concurrency, isolation level
- Scaling strategy, replication, partitioning
2. Key data structures and algorithms: time and space complexity, key implementation details, concurrency, parallelism
3. Service communication, encodings, protocols (eg. protobuf, json, xml, rest, rpc, gql, http2, ws, webrtc, tcp, udp, etc.)
