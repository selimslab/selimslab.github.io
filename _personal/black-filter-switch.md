Take the event in podle nahonu, when I first seen the place I thought how could people be happy here? It's so far etc. although I knew exactly where is it and how is its transport. Then I went to the opposite side and started to treat it as the best single place in the city. The best ever home in the city. 
The same thing happened when I change classes in 2011 
when i was deciding between dersanes in 2012 
when i was choosing a bolum in 2013 
i was in top 300 and i was feeling miserable because it might not be enough to go into boun ee and boun ee was the key to the eternal happiness and when the guide woman said then you can go IE it seemed such a bad choice to me because I was fixated on EE 
then 1.5 years in, i was sick and tired of EE and applied to transfer IE. Then I felt stupid and second guessed myself, thought IE was empty etc. and returned to EE to suffer for 2 years. 
happened with eces
Happened in podle nahonu vs hermanova 
Happened in buying a flat with credit thing
Happened in oslo vs prague 
Don't know why but it's a big problem in my life. 

When I am making a decision, I look at an issue mostly from a single side and after a while a switch goes of in my mind and I see the issue completely from another side. The black becomes white and white becomes black. Then I feel such an intense regret of choosing this instead of that and I feel so stupid and powerless and I keep torturing myself for it. The decision seems like the most important thing, as if all my happiness depends on it. And if it happens one way, it'll fix everything and if happens another way it'll ruin everything

How realistic is it? How can my happiness and destiny depend on a single parameter? How can know all the possible results of a decision? How can I compare my real life with an imaginary life? 

Given my mental state and knowledge of the world at the time, I tried to make the best possible decision. It may turn out to be the wrong path but it doesn't matter. What matters is if I had my due diligence and tried to see the thing on all possible sides, objectively, without fixating on a few aspects of it, or reflecting my biases on it. 

This obsession and fixation on a single side of a situation creates these intense feelings of regret. 

Ok, good decisons come from experience and experience comes from bad decisions. 

Nothing is lost, I'm 28-29 and I have at least 20 more years to work if I live. I can learn from my mistakes and make my future better. 

I assigned too much meaning to externals and got my answer, now I will focus on the reality, the things that doesn't go away, the things that don't depend on anyone else but exist by themselves like experience, hard work, discipline, habits, systems, ..

It may still be helpful to discuss these issues with a psych expert
