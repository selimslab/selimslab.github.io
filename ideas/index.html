<article>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">How much of our lives have we spent fighting shadows rather than simply enjoying the sun?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Never put off till tomorrow what may be done day after tomorrow just as well</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Know where to stop</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Mischief, thou art afoot, 
 Take thou what course thou wilt!</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">On the day they were to kill him, 
 Santiago Nasar arose at five-thirty in the morning 
 to wait for the boat carrying the bishop</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Hope itself is often better than what you are hoping for</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The fool doth think he is wise, 
 but the wise man knows himself to be a fool</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The work is forgotten, kindness and love remains</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Judge less, accept more</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">..With all memory and fate, 
 Driven deep beneath the waves</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I don't go looking for trouble. Trouble usually finds me</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Action is the antidote to despair</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">If you're too open-minded; your brains will fall out</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">If you can't forgive others, how can you forgive yourself?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Success comes from genuine interest</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Take a walk</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Everything you can imagine is real</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">May it be a light to you in dark places, 
 when all other lights go out</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">And the first one now 
 Will later be last 
 For the times they are a-changin'</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Don't let the bastards grind you down</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Don't compromise yourself - you're all you have</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">It's not personal</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">If you know when to stop, you are in no danger</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. 
 The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You can choose a different path</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Mistakes of others are easier to notice than our own</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">False hopes are more dangerous than fears</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">There is only one day left, always starting over</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Live as if you listen to music, or you play music</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Sub specie aeternitatis</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Criticize less, appreciate more</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Walk slowly but walk</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Life will follow its path, neither reverse nor check its course, nor remind you of its swiftness, but glide on quietly</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Consider beginnings</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings 
 Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Love is the absence of judgment</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Past glories are poor feeding</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Ashes to ashes</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The more I see, the less I know, the more I like to let it go</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You can have too much liberty, equality, or truth, 
 yet not too much justice</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Only with the heart one can see, 
 what is essential is invisible to the eye</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">A man's got to know his limitations</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The truth is rarely pure and never simple</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">What would your best version do?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The future depends on what you do today</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">This is it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">...remember that what has once been done may be done again</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You make your habits, then your habits make you</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Inside every old person is a young person wondering what happened</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Desire is the mind-killer</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The best way to predict the future is to create it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The trouble with an open mind is that people will try to put things in it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">We should all start to live before we get too old. Fear is stupid. So are regrets</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Stupidity is not ignorance, it is using the wrong mental model</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">All is well that ends well</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Let not future troubles you, for you will have the same reason</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Short cuts make long delays</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Stand at the brink of the abyss of despair, 
 and when you see that you cannot bear it anymore, 
 draw back a little and have a cup of tea</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I'd rather be happy than right any day</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">For the loser now 
 Will be later to win 
 For the times they are a-changin'</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I look at the world 
 And I notice it's turning 
 While my guitar gently weeps</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Happy slaves are the bitterest enemy of freedom</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Then quit. No use being a damn fool about it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Experiences make us happier than material things</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Everybody gotta learn sometime</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Don't think or judge, just listen</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">If you got it, you'd be happy</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The hour's getting late</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">It's impossible. 
 No, it's necessary</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Man only likes to count his troubles; he doesn't calculate his happiness</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Any fool can know. The point is to understand</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The weak can never forgive</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Hell is truth seen too late</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The point is, who will stop me?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Expect everything, there might be no tomorrow morning for you</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Of course motivation is not permanent. But then, neither is bathing</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">How would you live if you had two years left? 
 You may even have less</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Nature doesn't hurry, yet everything is accomplished</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">One can't fight with oneself, for this battle has only one loser</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask what's for lunch</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Never go to bed mad. Stay up and fight</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Neither blame yourself nor others</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Success is being free</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">These violent delights have violent ends</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Living is easy with eyes closed 
 Misunderstanding all you see</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Comparison is the thief of joy</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">What happens to a dream deferred?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The future is not written yet 
 It depends on what you do today</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Begin at the beginning, the King said, very gravely, 
 and go on till you come to the end: then stop</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Under the bludgeonings of chance, 
 My head is bloody, but unbowed</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Don't be so humble, you're not that great</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">People see/hear/think what they want</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Context is worth 80 IQ points</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Ride 
 ride for ruin 
 And the world's ending</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Action is the antidote to despair</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, 
 Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon 
 when his father took him to discover ice</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Finish each day and be done with it 
 Tomorrow is a new day, leave your old nonsense behind</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Make your mistakes, take your chances, look silly, but keep on going. Don‚Äôt freeze up</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">It won't be as good as you hope, neither as bad as you fear</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">A distracted mind is a weak mind</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">How many roads must a man walk down 
 Before you call him a man?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Happy families are all alike; 
 every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Treat people with kindness and respect, 
 out of principle, 
 even when they don't deserve it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Though this be madness, yet there is method in't</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Life is a great balancing act</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Wherever you go, there you are</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">This is not misfortune, to bear this worthily is good fortune</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">With every mistake, 
 We must surely be learning 
 Still my guitar gently weeps</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I pensieri stretti ed il viso sciolto</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Life is a celebration</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Whatever it is you're seeking won't come in the form you're expecting</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">It's only terrible to have nothing to wait for</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You never know what worse luck your bad luck has saved you from</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">It's too easy to take good health for granted</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Is this the most important thing you should work on?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The power of the unaided mind is highly overrated</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Have little and gain much 
 Have much and be confused</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Life is what happens when you're not looking at a screen</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Soft overcomes hard 
 Weak overcomes strong</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Do what is right, not what is easy nor what is popular</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Sic vita est</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Being busy is wasting time</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Happiness, only real when shared</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Give a man a fire and he's warm for a day, but set fire to him and he's warm for the rest of his life</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Right words sound wrong</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">And if you listen very hard 
 The tune will come to you at last</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">There must be some kind of way outta here, 
 Said the joker to the thief</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">How many seas must a white dove sail 
 Before she sleeps on the sand?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Walk no more in shadows</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Half doing is an expensive way of not doing</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, 
 his brain dried up and he went completely out of mind</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Fear both the heat and the cold of your heart, 
 and try to have patience, if you can</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">..The dawn mist glowing 
 The water flowing 
 The endless river 
 Forever and ever</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Many that live deserve death 
  And some that die deserve life. 
 Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">And you better start swimmin' 
 Or you'll sink like a stone 
 For the times they are a-changin'</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Never wrestle with a pig, you get dirty; and besides, the pig likes it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Exercise makes the day</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I'm not in this world to live up to your expectations and you're not in this world to live up to mine</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">..The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
 The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Of all horrible religions, the most horrible is the worship of the god within</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">They love their hair because they're not smart enough to love something more interesting</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">FEAR stands for fuck everything and run</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Don't be unhappy before the crisis comes</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Good is better than perfect</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Do nothing against your will, 
 nor against community, 
 nor without due examination, 
 nor with reluctancy</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Information isn't free, you pay for it with attention and focus</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The measure of intelligence is the ability to change</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The line it is drawn 
 The curse it is cast 
 The slow one now 
 Will later be fast 
 As the present now 
 Will later be past 
 The order is rapidly fadin'</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">How would your best version handle this?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Often times we call a man cold when he is only sad</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Any fool can make a rule 
 And any fool will mind it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Give support, not advice</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">There is nothing new under the sun</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Leave it better than you found</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Make it work but also make it beautiful</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Hell is empty and all the devils are here</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You don't have to get everything right. 
 Define the few that must be right, 
 and let go of the rest</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I wandered lonely as a cloud</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The trouble with being in the rat race is that even if you win, you're still a rat</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Create more than you consume</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The pain is neither unbearable nor unending, 
 as long as you keep in mind its limits, 
 and don't magnify them in your imagination</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Do not go gentle into that good night. 
 Rage, rage against the dying of the light</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Do what you feel in your heart to be right ‚Äì for you'll be criticized anyway</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">What are the most important problems in your field, 
 and why are you not working on them?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I read a book one day and my whole life was changed</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The mind can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Never attempt to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and annoys the pig</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">We are the Dead. Short days ago 
 We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">All could go wrong yet only a few did</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I don't know enough about this to have an opinion</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Nature doesn't make long speeches</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I think I've discovered the secret of life -- you just hang around until you get used to it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I am free of all prejudice. I hate everyone equally</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Focus on what is important</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Environment affects us more than we suspect</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">California dreamin' 
 On such a winter's day</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Ars longa, vita brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">We overvalue people we don't know and undervalue those we do</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Do nothing in anger</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Cast aside fear and regret, do the deed at hand</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Exercise is a wonder drug</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">My ambition is handicapped by laziness</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Was du erlebst, kann keine macht der Welt dir rauben</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Old pond... 
 a frog jumps in 
 water's sound</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Life is pain, highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I'm not young enough to know everything</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Very little is needed to make a happy life; 
 it is all within yourself, 
 in your way of thinking</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Take the best and spread it around</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Let's take the backstreet though</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I just did some calculations and I've been able to determine that you're full of shit</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">So through the night rode Paul Revere; 
 In the hour of darkness and peril and need</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Expect less, give more</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Let no man pull you so low as to hate him</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">It's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">In the beginning, the universe was created. 
 This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Âè§Ê±†„ÇÑ ËõôÈ£õ„Å≥Ëæº„ÇÄ Ê∞¥„ÅÆÈü≥</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Wars not make one great</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You can always choose your way</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Do. Or do not. There is no try</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I don't need no arms around me 
 And I don't need no drugs to calm me</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I always arrive late at the office, but I make up for it by leaving early</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Rare as is true love, true friendship is rarer</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You can't stay in your corner of the Forest waiting for others to come to you. You have to go to them sometimes</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Set aside your opinion, listen with a beginner's mind</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">But yesterday the word of Caesar might 
 Have stood against the world; 
 now lies he there</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Never miss a good chance to shut up</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Suit up!</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Stay humble</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">If you are making mistakes...you're Doing Something</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I'm killing time while I wait for life to shower me with meaning and happiness</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The great way is low and plain, 
 but people like shortcuts over the mountains</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">When you get it, will you still want it?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Hope excites more hope, ambition more ambition</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Neither blame yourself nor others</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">What does your heart tell you?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">So it begins</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">..Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">This life's hard, but it's harder if you're stupid</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Things flourish then perish</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The world owes you nothing. It was here first</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I have seen these trees innumerable times 
 yet have I appreciated them?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">To live till you die, 
 is to live long enough</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Even the darkest night will end, 
 and the sun will rise</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">O snail 
 Climb Mount Fuji, 
 But slowly, slowly!</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Need little, want less</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Truth has many faces</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Expect less, appreciate more</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">What are men to rocks and mountains?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">It's only a drop of possible troubles 
 all could go wrong yet only a few did</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You can, you should, and if you're brave enough to start, you will</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Don't take yourself too seriously</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Whether to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, 
 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">A fit, healthy body is the best fashion statement</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">All that is gold does not glitter, 
 Not all those who wander are lost</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">April is the cruellest month</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You can't argue with all the fools in the world</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Outta order? I'll show you outta order!</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Each of us can heal</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Grinding your wheels won't solve your problem</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Do your thing and don't care if they like it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You become what you give your attention to</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Nothing in excess</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Suspend judgment</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Difficulties vanish when faced boldly</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">What do you NOT want in life?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Past and future are only in your head</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Oh well, whatever, never mind</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Focus on what is in your control</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I think that I shall never see 
 A poem lovely as a tree</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">It's not personal</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">We deal out judgment to others and seek understanding for ourselves</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">..silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Give your mind some space</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Are you still young and dumb enough to know everything?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">If you are going through hell, keep going</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Like all magnificent things, it's very simple</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The world needs a wash and a week's rest</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Lay your weary head to rest</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The most certain sign of wisdom is cheerfulness</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I see my red door and I want it painted black</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Wealth is being content, greed is a curse</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she seldom followed it)</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Enabling great good is also enabling great evil</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Poets have been mysteriously silent on the subject of cheese</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Enjoy the sun</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">What is better than freedom and love?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">C'est la vie</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Dust to dust</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Take a sad song and make it better</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; 
 The best lack all conviction, 
 while the worst, 
 Are full of passionate intensity</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The price of freedom is dear yet worths it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Think of yourself as dead 
 You have lived your life. 
 Now take what's left and live it properly</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Don't panic</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">In real life, I assure you, there is no such thing as algebra</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">No good deed goes unpunished</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">We wear the mask that grins and lies</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Go take a walk</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Go take a walk</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Do not lie to yourself</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">A problem well stated is a problem half-solved</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, 
 Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Nothing really matters, Anyone can see</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You cannot find peace by avoiding life</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Don't be a try-hard</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The first draft of anything is shit</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Confidence is ignorance. If you're feeling cocky, it's because there's something you don't know</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">If you can keep your head when all about you 
 Are losing theirs and blaming it on you</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Hands of a king are hands of a healer</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">We jump to conclusions and oversimplify</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; 
 I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Always go to other people's funerals, otherwise they won't come to yours</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">What matters most is how well you walk through the fire</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">There will come soft rains</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Be here and now</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">My course is set for an uncharted sea</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You must make a decision that you are going to move on</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, 
 for they are subtle and quick to anger</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">You're the average of the five people you spend the most time with</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Fear leads to anger 
 Anger leads to hate 
 Hate leads to suffering</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Judge less, accept more</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Beautiful is the moment, 
 When the heart indifferent 
 But finds time to just be</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Predicting the future is overrated</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Whatever you are, be a good one</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Well, I never heard it before, but it sounds uncommon nonsense</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The planet is fine. The people are fucked</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Nothing that is worth knowing can be taught</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">No one will bring back the years; no one will restore you to yourself</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Fear is the path to the dark side</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Look below the surface</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Expect less, appreciate more</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Happiness consists in getting enough sleep. Just that, nothing more</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">All along the watchtower, princes kept a view</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Time is heavy only when it is empty</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">hollowed out, clay makes a pot 
 where the pot is not, is where it's useful</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">All in all it's just another brick in the wall</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Il faut cultiver notre jardin</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">It has to be simple to be reliable</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">There are years that ask questions and years that answer</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Treat the small as large, the few as many, easy as hard</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Aus so krummem Holze, 
 als woraus der Mensch gemacht ist, 
 kann nichts ganz Gerades gezimmert werden</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Come out better on the other side</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">If cats looked like frogs we'd realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. 
 Style. That's what people remember</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">In the white room with black curtains 
 Near the station</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">I have substituted myself for providence in rewarding the good; 
 may the God of vengeance now yield me his place to punish the wicked</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">How miserable to acquire by toil and keep by worry</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">It's good to learn from your mistakes, 
 even better to learn from the mistakes of others</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">For even the very wise cannot see all ends</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Fear is the mind-killer</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Resist much, obey little</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Courage is found in unlikely places</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Take responsibility of your own happiness, never put it in other people's hands</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Be kind to yourself. If you won't, who will?</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-line;">..Be a simple man, be something you love and understand</p>
