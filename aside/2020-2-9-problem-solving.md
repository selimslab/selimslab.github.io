<br>

prevention is the best 

do pre-mortems 

<br>

Don't panic 

start with a sanity check 

ask a lot of questions

<br>

state the problem clearly

state your assumptions

question assumptions 

<br>

start small  

a simple example 

a simple solution

Complex is the sum of many simple steps

<br>

Go see the source 

Seek the root cause. 

Ask why why why why why

<br>

take a walk
