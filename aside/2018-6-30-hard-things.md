Define what you want because a weak definition means a bad outcome 

<br>

Make the effort to know someone or something or don't assume you know them 

<br>

Over-confidence is enemy of competence. be aware of your weaknesses 

<br>

Hire for strength rather than lack of weaknesses 

<br>

Move on with the misery and focus on solution 

<br>

Focus on what you need to get right,

and stop worrying for the rest
