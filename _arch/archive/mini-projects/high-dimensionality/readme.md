##Â Classification of high dimensional data 

high dimensionality makes it harder to visualize the data and to build a model

Luckily, sometimes a few dimensions explain most of the variability

Here 96 dimensional feature vectors generated by Gaussian distributions 
are reduced to 3 dimensions using Principal Componenet Analysis

They are visualized and classified

This is also a comparison of full scikit-learn classification suit
