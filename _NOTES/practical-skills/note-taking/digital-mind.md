A space to organize thoughts 

A place of your own,  a home on the internet, [designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)

Not some BigCo walled garden but your own digital garden

Ideas, pictures, drawings, papers, blog posts, little notes, drafts

Ideas spark each other 

---

Spaced repetition

Easy access to the content you find worth remembering 

Having control of your content

---

Remember, reuse, reorg 

Simplify and organize

Give your mind some space
