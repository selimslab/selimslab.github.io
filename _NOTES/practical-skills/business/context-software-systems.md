This is a software company I have started just after graduation and run for two years, 

2 focus areas were:
1. less technical founders wishing to build a proof of concept or MVP to get feedback on their idea 
2. established startups wishing to go faster, and delegating a sub-system to another company is much faster than hiring engineers, and much more reliable than freelancers

<p class="img-alt">the logo is a zen circle and the greek letter Ξ (ξ, Xi)</p>


Designed and built proof of concepts, backend systems, data pipelines, ML and NLP models 

Most of the clients come through references, 

The scope and depth of the projects grew, as my technical depth and business acumen  

Discontinued after two years to pursue other opportunities, 

Starting a business is a great way to create value

It has also a lot of overhead and sometimes I felt like butter spread over too much bread -> [[mastery-comes-from-focus]] 

Overall it is less comfortable yet more exciting 

I would like to start a much better business when the time is right
