Mastery comes from focus and deliberate practice, 

A wide variety of experiences might lead to well-roundedness, but not to greatness, nor even goodness.

You get better by solving even harder problems over time 

Making a lot of mistakes and learning from them, having expert mentors to avoid some mistakes and notice others for you don't have time to make all the mistakes 

Musicians get better by practice and tackling harder and harder pieces, not by switching instruments or genres, nor by learning more and varied easy pieces. Ditto almost every other specialty inhabited by experts or masters.

You don't level up by switching games all the time, but by sticking with one long enough to gain advanced skills.
