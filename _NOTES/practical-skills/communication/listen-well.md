Listen more than you speak

Be present, be interested

If you are not interested, walk away.

---

Set aside your opinion

Listen with a beginner’s mind.

Suspend judgment, it’s not personal, not about you 

Argue less, listen more

---

Listen to understand, not to answer.

Do not offer solutions, just listen.

Listen to what isn't being said, too

You are in charge when you listen
