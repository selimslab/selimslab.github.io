Understand and accept that you will make mistakes. 

The Ego's trick is always the same. Make it personal. Make it about me. Put me at the center. So our job is to not let it. 

It's not my problem, it's the problem. 

It's not my idea, just the idea.

You are not your code. 

“Ego and mastery exist on opposite ends of the same continuum. The more one leans towards ego, the further one is from mastery” ― Sam Yang


Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.
