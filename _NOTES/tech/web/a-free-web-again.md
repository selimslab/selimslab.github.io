The web has born open and free

And it turned to a web of deception, 

treating users as not humans but attention machines to make money for corporate overlords 

The web is festered with ad networks, attention traps, and dark patterns [[hijacked-minds]]

We can reject to be their useful tools, 

the least we can do are

1. publish our own websites, regaining control and ownership of our digital life
2. quit invasive social networks
3. set up adblockers and privacy tools to prevent ad networks wasting our time 
4. support the content we value
