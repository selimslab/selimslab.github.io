A pragmatic language, values your time over the machine's time 

Makes sense for many kinds of problems 

It's a tool I enjoy to use

It gets out of your way and enables you to express yourself comfortably 

After a while it starts to feel like speaking plain English

There is a drawback with flexible and expressive languages like Python, Ruby, or Lisp, they don't enforce rules and structure so its easy to do things in clever and convoluted ways 

So it requires self discipline from the team to keep a project well organized, readable, and maintainable 

For example list comprehensions brings great expressive power but you will also see people writing unnecessarily complicated list comprehensions 

Check out poetry, mypy, pydantic, pylint, autoflake, autopep8, isort, black, pytest, coverage, pre-commit, loguru, ..
