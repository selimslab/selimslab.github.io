"All models are wrong but some are useful"

The chassis - Client-side/Front End

Dashboard - Analytics 

Interior controls - UI design 

The overall feeling of driving experience - UX

Warning Lights - Monitoring

Software is also similar to craft and mathematics, too 

A building metaphor is also used, software "architecture", software "development"
