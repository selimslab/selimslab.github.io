What's not on the menu?

Fear of missing out

Slot machine in your pocket,

- irregular, intermittent reward schedule
- the feeling of a 'near-miss'

Social approval

Reciprocity, you like me, I like you

Infinite feeds

Autoplay

Bottomless bowls

Interruption is good for business

Make it hard to cancel
