The past had to be this way given all the factors

Many inputs come together and create an outcome, it's not all your fault 

---

How can you make good moves without mistakes?

How can you have good ideas without trying many bad ones?

---

We blame ourselves but most things are so random

Much of what we get, we donâ€™t deserve

What is the point of torturing yourself?

---

Neither blame yourself nor others

It's not worth your peace of mind 

Forgive yourself, forgive others 

Anger, regret, grudge, .. 

Why carry this baggage? 

Learn and move on
