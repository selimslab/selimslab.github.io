Do not regret mistakes, 

You need a lot of mistakes for a few good moves, 

a lot bad ideas for a few good ideas. 


---

its not all your fault 

In the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret

---

Do not fear making mistakes, 

you are growing a mistake at a time 

---

We blame ourselves but most things are so random

Suspicious of success, gentle on ourselves in failure

Much of what we get, we don’t deserve

"The longer we dwell on our misfortunes, the greater is their power to harm us" Voltaire 


“Don’t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.”
