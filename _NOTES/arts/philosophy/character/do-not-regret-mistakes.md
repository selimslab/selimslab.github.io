You need a lot of mistakes for a few good moves, 

a lot of bad ideas for a few good ideas.

Its not all your fault 

In the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret

We blame ourselves but most things are so random

Much of what we get, we don’t deserve

Suspicious of success, gentle on ourselves in failure

"The longer we dwell on our misfortunes, the greater is their power to harm us" Voltaire 


“Don’t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.”
