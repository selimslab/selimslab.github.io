Let not future troubles you, for you will have the same reason 

Worrying doesnâ€™t make it one bit better, 

Use your energy to act instead

[[action-is-the-antidote-to-despair]]

"How does it help to make troubles heavier by bemoaning them" Seneca 

The present moment is all we have, no one can lose the past or the future, for how can one lose something thats not theirs? 

Then the longest and the shortest life are the same, for you can only lose the present moment
