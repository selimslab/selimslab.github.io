Warfare is deception 

Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.

if you can attack, seem unable 

seem inactive if you are active 

seem far when near, near when far 


---

Pretend to be weak so they grow arrogant 

Irritate the enemy, make them angry

If you can't control your anger, you lose 

---

Attack unexpectedly. Be prepared and wait to take them unprepared
