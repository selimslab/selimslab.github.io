We humans name and separate things, so we can understand it 

The distinction is artificial

When you take a tree, you must also take the roots, soil, clouds, and sun with you 

You take a tree and the whole universe comes with it 

You are not a separate being against a cold indifferent universe, 

You are part of the whole, you are home 

There is no you 

Now our minds are one
