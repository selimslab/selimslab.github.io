We name things so we can talk about them. It's like drawing a line in the sand, it might be useful but it's artificial. Names don't exist outside our heads.   

A tree might seem like one separate thing but it could not exist without water, soil, and the sun. You take a tree and the sun comes with it 

Or take an animal, 

Carbon in proteins, calcium in bones, iron in the blood, and oxygen in the air; all created in the heart of distant stars

You take one thing and the whole universe comes with it

High and low

Long and short 

Sound and silence 

Yin and yang 

Difficult and easy

Good and evil 

Dark and light 

They define each other 

Sides of the same coin

Self is an illusion 

Now our minds are one
