We name things so we can talk about them. It's like drawing a line in the sand, it might be useful but it's artificial. Names don't exist outside our heads.   

For example, a tree could not exist without water, roots, soil, clouds, and the sun.

You take a tree and the whole universe comes with it

Dark and light 

Difficult and easy

Long and short 

High and low

Sound and silence 

Yin and yang 

Good and evil 

They define each other 

Sides of the same coin

We are part of the whole, we are home 

Self is an illusion 

Now our minds are one
