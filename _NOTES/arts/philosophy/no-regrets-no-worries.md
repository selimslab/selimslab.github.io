Learn from the past and move on. Good judgment comes from making a lot of mistakes. Be kind to yourself. If you won't, who will?
[[the-past]]

Consider beginnings. Solve problems while they are still small. [[do-without-doing]]

You become what you do. Garbage in, garbage out. Do your best, here and now. [[one-bit-better]]


- The past had to be this way given all the factors. Many inputs come together and create an outcome, it's not all your fault 
- How can you make good moves without mistakes?
- How can you have good ideas without trying many bad ones?
- We blame ourselves but most things are so random. Much of what we get, we donâ€™t deserve. Neither blame yourself nor others
- Would you treat a beloved friend as you treat yourself?
- Forgive yourself, forgive others 
- Do not carry baggage 
- Learn and move on 
- The future is unpredictable, prepare without worry
