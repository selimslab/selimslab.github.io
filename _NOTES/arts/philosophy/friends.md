After health, friends are a key part of a good life  

“Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.”
― C.S. Lewis, The Four Loves

“The capacity for friendship is God's way of apologizing for our families.”

“When you stop expecting people to be perfect, you can like them for who they are.”
