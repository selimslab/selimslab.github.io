Two hands clap and there is a sound. What is the sound of one hand?

One said, “The flag moves.”

The other said, “The wind moves.”

the third said, "It is your mind that moves."

"The world is vast and wide. Why do you put on your robes at the sound of a bell?"

"Why do you not enter? - I do not see myself as outside. Why enter?"

When you can do nothing, what can you do?

When the many are reduced to one, to what is the one reduced?

Where were you before you were born?
