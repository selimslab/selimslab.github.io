The price of freedom is dear yet worth it 

[[you-can-always-choose-your-way]]

Freedom is to have time for yourself and your loved ones, to be your master

Freedom is to conquer your dark side, your anger, greed, pride, ..

Freedom from pain, fear, regret, worry, greed, anger, hate, and egoism, ... 

It's not the absence of negatives but not being controlled by them; the reign of a rational mind and a loving heart  

"He who does not move, does not notice his chains"

"In this age, the mere example of non-conformity is a service" John Stuart Mill 

“What destroys a man more quickly than to work, think, and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire, without pleasure — as a mere automaton of duty?” – Friedrich Nietzsche, The Antichrist
