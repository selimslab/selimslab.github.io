"Well being is attained little by little, and nevertheless is no little thing itself" 

You become what you think and do, day by day. Do your best, here and now. 

Nature does not hurry yet everything is accomplished.

Start from your head, heart, and hands, and then work outward 

Walk slowly but walk 🐢
