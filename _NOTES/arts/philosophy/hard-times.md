This too shall pass

"It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.”

No winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn

Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise

If you are going through hell, keep going

What matters most is how well you walk through the fire

"So we shall let the reader answer this question for himself: who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?”

"And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.”

Channel your pain to build strength. 

There will come soft rains

Walk no more in shadows 

Difficulties vanish when faced boldly

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

Cast aside fear and regret, do the deed at hand

Courage is found in unlikely places 

May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out
