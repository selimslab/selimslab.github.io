"May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out"

## It'll be over 

This too shall pass

Every night has a morning, every winter has a spring 

If you are going through hell, keep going

There will come soft rains

## Be easy on yourself 

How much of our lives have we spent fighting shadows rather than simply enjoying the sun? Walk no more in shadows 

"The pain is neither unbearable nor unending, as long as you keep in mind its limits, and don't magnify them in your imagination"

"It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.‚Äù

Prepare for hard times if you can but don't be unhappy before the crisis comes

## Face it 

Difficulties vanish when faced boldly

Under the bludgeonings of chance, My head is bloody, but unbowed

Courage is found in unlikely places. Cast aside fear and regret, do the deed at hand

## Come out better on the other side 

Who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed? 

When you come out of the storm, you won't be the same person who walked in

Channel your pain to build strength.
