"If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"

— Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago 1918–1956.

"For neither good nor evil can last for ever; and so it follows that as evil has lasted a long time, good must now be close at hand."

— Miguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote

This one is gambler's fallacy but hopeful
