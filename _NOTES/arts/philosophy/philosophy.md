## Action 

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”
― Theodore Roosevelt

## Free will

We might have less free will than we think

Many factors shape us, culture, society, geography, zeitgeist, ...  

"What we call human nature is mostly culture"  _Margaret Mead 

"People are a product of the time they live and few can raise above the ideas of the time" _Voltaire_ 


## Idleness

<https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/>

Nature is balancing but humans are greedy

## Know where to stop 

"Begin at the beginning," the King said, very gravely, 

"and go on till you come to the end: then stop."

"If you know when to stop, you are in no danger" 

Never miss a good chance to shut up

## Let go 

"That is why it is so important to let certain things go. To release them. To cut loose. People need to understand that no one is playing with marked cards; sometimes we win and sometimes we lose. Don't expect to get anything back, don't expect recognition for your efforts, don't expect your genius to be discovered or your love to be understood. Complete the circle. Not out of pride, inability or arrogance, but simply because whatever it is no longer fits in your life. Close the door, change the record, clean the house, get rid of the dust. Stop being who you were and become who you are.”

## Look below the surface 

If you only see the obvious, you win by difficulty 

If you look below the surface, you win with ease 

## Moderation

"Its braver to overcome desire than to conquer enemy, for the hardest victory is over self" Aristotle 

"How trivial the things we want so passionately are" MA 

"A brief existence is common to all things yet you avoid and pursue them as if they are eternal" MA 

[[the-less-the-better]]


## Play 

Do not expect to "get” anything 

Do not expect to be better 

Live as if you listen to music, or you play music 

Play the game 

The aim is the play itself 

## Prudence 

"...although the young may be experts in geometry and mathematics and similar branches of knowledge [sophoi], we do not consider that a young man can have Prudence [phronimos]. The reason is that Prudence [phronesis] includes a knowledge of particular facts, and this is derived from experience, which a young man does not possess; for experience is the fruit of years." _Aristotle_ 

## Seeking 

"Whatever it is you're seeking won't come in the form you're expecting.”
― Haruki Marukami

## Stupidity

It is not ignorance, smart or educated people can also be very stupid

It's false confidence and closed-mindedness

Using mental models not matching the reality

Poor judgment

Hanlon's Razor, think stupidity before malice
