"This is our big mistake to think death is in the future. most of the death is already gone. Whatever time has passed belongs to death" Seneca 

We can only lose what we have. And this exact moment is all we have so we can't lose the past or the future. How can you lose something that's not yours? 

Living until you die is living long enough.

"What's unusual about medical professionals is not how much treatment they get when faced with a terminal illnessâ€”but how little.

There will be no heroics, and I will go gentle into that good night. Like my mentor Charlie. Like my cousin Torch. Like my fellow doctors."
