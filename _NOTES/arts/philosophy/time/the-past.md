The past had to be this way given all the factors. Many inputs come together and create an outcome, it's not all your fault. 

Good judgment comes from making a lot of mistakes. How can you make good moves without mistakes? How can you have good ideas without trying many bad ones?

We blame ourselves but most things are so random. Much of what we get, we donâ€™t deserve. 
Neither blame yourself nor others. Forgive yourself, forgive others. Leave the baggage. 

Would you treat a beloved friend as you treat yourself? Be kind to yourself. If you won't, who will? 

Learn from the past and move on.
