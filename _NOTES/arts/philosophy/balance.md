Nature is balancing, 

brings the high down, 

lifts the low, 

takes from those who have,

gives to those who have not

People are not so, 

They take from who have not 

and fill up those who have

Water becomes clear when its still for a while, 

If it stays still too much, it becomes unclean,  

So there is a balance
