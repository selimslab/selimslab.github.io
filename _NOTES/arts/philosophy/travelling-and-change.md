Travelling is romanticized and hyped because its good for business 

“Travelers change their sky but not their soul.”

"Wherever you go, there you are"


"You don’t have to go out the door

to know what goes on in the world.

You don’t have to look out the window

to see the way of heaven.

The farther you go,

the less you know."

*Tao Te Ching*
