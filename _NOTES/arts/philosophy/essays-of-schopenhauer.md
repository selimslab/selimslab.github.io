In these pages I shall speak of The Wisdom of Life in the common meaning
of the term, as the art, namely, of ordering our lives so as to obtain the
greatest possible amount of pleasure and success; an art the theory of
which may be called Eudaemonology, for it teaches us how to lead a happy
existence. Such an existence might perhaps be defined as one which,
looked at from a purely objective point of view, or, rather, after cool and
mature reflection—for the question necessarily involves subjective
considerations,—would be decidedly preferable to non-existence; implying
that we should cling to it for its own sake, and not merely from the fear of
death; and further, that we should never like it to come to an end.
Now whether human life corresponds, or could possibly correspond, to
this conception of existence, is a question to which, as is well-known, my
philosophical system returns a negative answer. On the eudaemonistic
hypothesis, however, the question must be answered in the affirmative;
and I have shown, in the second volume of my chief work (ch. 49), that this
hypothesis is based upon a fundamental mistake. Accordingly, in
elaborating the scheme of a happy existence, I have had to make a
complete surrender of the higher metaphysical and ethical standpoint to
which my own theories lead; and everything I shall say here will to some
extent rest upon a compromise; in so far, that is, as I take the common
standpoint of every day, and embrace the error which is at the bottom of it.
My remarks, therefore, will possess only a qualified value, for the very
word eudaemonology is a euphemism. Further, I make no claims to
completeness; partly because the subject is inexhaustible, and partly
because I should otherwise have to say over again what has been already
said by others.
The only book composed, as far as I remember, with a like purpose to that
which animates this collection of aphorisms, is Cardan's De utilitate ex
adversis capienda, which is well worth reading, and may be used to
supplement the present work. Aristotle, it is true, has a few words on
eudaemonology in the fifth chapter of the first book of his Rhetoric; but
what he says does not come to very much. As compilation is not my
business, I have made no use of these predecessors; more especially
because in the process of compiling, individuality of view is lost, and
individuality of view is the kernel of works of this kind. In general, indeed,
the wise in all ages have always said the same thing, and the fools, who at
all times form the immense majority, have in their way too acted alike, and
done just the opposite; and so it will continue. For, as Voltaire says, we
shall leave this world as foolish and as wicked as we found it on our
arrival.
# THE WISDOM OF LIFE.
## CHAPTER I.
DIVISION OF THE SUBJECT.
Aristotle divides the blessings of life into three classes—those which come
to us from without, those of the soul, and those of the body. Keeping
nothing of this division but the number, I observe that the fundamental
differences in human lot may be reduced to three distinct classes:
(1) What a man is: that is to say, personality, in the widest sense of the
word; under which are included health, strength, beauty, temperament,
moral character, intelligence, and education.
(2) What a man has: that is, property and possessions of every kind.
(3) How a man stands in the estimation of others: by which is to be
understood, as everybody knows, what a man is in the eyes of his
fellowmen, or, more strictly, the light in which they regard him. This is
shown by their opinion of him; and their opinion is in its turn manifested
by the honor in which he is held, and by his rank and reputation.

The differences which come under the first head are those which Nature
herself has set between man and man; and from this fact alone we may at
once infer that they influence the happiness or unhappiness of mankind in
a much more vital and radical way than those contained under the two
following heads, which are merely the effect of human arrangements.
Compared with genuine personal advantages, such as a great mind or a
great heart, all the privileges of rank or birth, even of royal birth, are but as
kings on the stage, to kings in real life. The same thing was said long ago
by Metrodorus, the earliest disciple of Epicurus, who wrote as the title of
one of his chapters, The happiness we receive from ourselves is greater
than that which we obtain from our surroundings And it is an obvious fact,
which cannot be called in question, that the principal element in a man's
well-being,—indeed, in the whole tenor of his existence,—is what he is
made of, his inner constitution. For this is the immediate source of that
inward satisfaction or dissatisfaction resulting from the sum total of his
sensations, desires and thoughts; whilst his surroundings, on the other
hand, exert only a mediate or indirect influence upon him. This is why the
same external events or circumstances affect no two people alike; even with
perfectly similar surroundings every one lives in a world of his own. For a
man has immediate apprehension only of his own ideas, feelings and
volitions; the outer world can influence him only in so far as it brings these
to life. The world in which a man lives shapes itself chiefly by the way in
which he looks at it, and so it proves different to different men; to one it is
barren, dull, and superficial; to another rich, interesting, and full of
meaning. On hearing of the interesting events which have happened in the
course of a man's experience, many people will wish that similar things
had happened in their lives too, completely forgetting that they should be
envious rather of the mental aptitude which lent those events the
significance they possess when he describes them; to a man of genius they
were interesting adventures; but to the dull perceptions of an ordinary
individual they would have been stale, everyday occurrences. This is in the
highest degree the case with many of Goethe's and Byron's poems, which
are obviously founded upon actual facts; where it is open to a foolish
reader to envy the poet because so many delightful things happened to
him, instead of envying that mighty power of phantasy which was capable
of turning a fairly common experience into something so great and
beautiful.

In the same way, a person of melancholy temperament will make a scene in
a tragedy out of what appears to the sanguine man only in the light of an
interesting conflict, and to a phlegmatic soul as something without any
meaning;—all of which rests upon the fact that every event, in order to be
realized and appreciated, requires the co-operation of two factors, namely,
a subject and an object, although these are as closely and necessarily
connected as oxygen and hydrogen in water. When therefore the objective
or external factor in an experience is actually the same, but the subjective or
personal appreciation of it varies, the event is just as much a different one
in the eyes of different persons as if the objective factors had not been alike;
for to a blunt intelligence the fairest and best object in the world presents
only a poor reality, and is therefore only poorly appreciated,—like a fine
landscape in dull weather, or in the reflection of a bad camera obscura. In
plain language, every man is pent up within the limits of his own
consciousness, and cannot directly get beyond those limits any more than
he can get beyond his own skin; so external aid is not of much use to him.
On the stage, one man is a prince, another a minister, a third a servant or a
soldier or a general, and so on,—mere external differences: the inner
reality, the kernel of all these appearances is the same—a poor player, with
all the anxieties of his lot. In life it is just the same. Differences of rank and
wealth give every man his part to play, but this by no means implies a
difference of inward happiness and pleasure; here, too, there is the same
being in all—a poor mortal, with his hardships and troubles. Though these
may, indeed, in every case proceed from dissimilar causes, they are in their
essential nature much the same in all their forms, with degrees of intensity
which vary, no doubt, but in no wise correspond to the part a man has to
play, to the presence or absence of position and wealth. Since everything
which exists or happens for a man exists only in his consciousness and
happens for it alone, the most essential thing for a man is the constitution
of this consciousness, which is in most cases far more important than the
circumstances which go to form its contents. All the pride and pleasure of
the world, mirrored in the dull consciousness of a fool, are poor indeed
compared with the imagination of Cervantes writing his Don Quixote in a
miserable prison. The objective half of life and reality is in the hand of fate,
and accordingly takes various forms in different cases: the subjective half is
ourself, and in essentials is always remains the same.

Hence the life of every man is stamped with the same character
throughout, however much his external circumstances may alter; it is like a
series of variations on a single theme. No one can get beyond his own
individuality. An animal, under whatever circumstances it is placed,
remains within the narrow limits to which nature has irrevocably
consigned it; so that our endeavors to make a pet happy must always keep
within the compass of its nature, and be restricted to what it can feel. So it
is with man; the measure of the happiness he can attain is determined
beforehand by his individuality. More especially is this the case with the
mental powers, which fix once for all his capacity for the higher kinds of
pleasure. If these powers are small, no efforts from without, nothing that
his fellowmen or that fortune can do for him, will suffice to raise him above
the ordinary degree of human happiness and pleasure, half animal though
it be; his only resources are his sensual appetite,—a cozy and cheerful
family life at the most,—low company and vulgar pastime; even education,
on the whole, can avail little, if anything, for the enlargement of his
horizon. For the highest, most varied and lasting pleasures are those of the
mind, however much our youth may deceive us on this point; and the
pleasures of the mind turn chiefly on the powers of the mind. It is clear,
then, that our happiness depends in a great degree upon what we are,
upon our individuality, whilst lot or destiny is generally taken to mean
only what we have, or our reputation. Our lot, in this sense, may improve;
but we do not ask much of it if we are inwardly rich: on the other hand, a
fool remains a fool, a dull blockhead, to his last hour, even though he were
surrounded by houris in paradise. This is why Goethe, in the Westöstliclien
Divan, says that every man, whether he occupies a low position
in life, or emerges as its victor, testifies to personality as the greatest factor
in happiness

Volk und Knecht und Uberwinder
Sie gestehen, zu jeder Zeit,
Höchtes Glück der Erdenkinder
Sei nur die Persönlichkeit.

Everything confirms the fact that the subjective element in life is
incomparably more important for our happiness and pleasure than the
objective, from such sayings as Hunger is the best sauce, and Youth and
Age cannot live together, up to the life of the Genius and the Saint. Health
outweighs all other blessings so much that one may really say that a
healthy beggar is happier than an ailing king. A quiet and cheerful
temperament, happy in the enjoyment of a perfectly sound physique, an
intellect clear, lively, penetrating and seeing things as they are, a moderate
and gentle will, and therefore a good conscience—these are privileges
which no rank or wealth can make up for or replace. For what a man is in
himself, what accompanies him when he is alone, what no one can give or
take away, is obviously more essential to him than everything he has in the
way of possessions, or even what he may be in the eyes of the world. An
intellectual man in complete solitude has excellent entertainment in his
own thoughts and fancies, while no amount of diversity or social pleasure,
theatres, excursions and amusements, can ward off boredom from a
dullard. A good, temperate, gentle character can be happy in needy
circumstances, whilst a covetous, envious and malicious man, even if he be
the richest in the world, goes miserable. Nay more; to one who has the
constant delight of a special individuality, with a high degree of intellect,
most of the pleasures which are run after by mankind are simply
superfluous; they are even a trouble and a burden. And so Horace says of
himself, that, however many are deprived of the fancy-goods of life, there
is one at least who can live without them

Gemmas, marmor, ebur, Tyrrhena sigilla, tabellas, Argentum, vestes,

Gaetulo murice tinctas Sunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat habere;
and when Socrates saw various articles of luxury spread out for sale, he
exclaimed: How much there is in the world I do not want.
So the first and most essential element in our life's happiness is what we
are,—our personality, if for no other reason than that it is a constant factor
coming into play under all circumstances: besides, unlike the blessings
which are described under the other two heads, it is not the sport of
destiny and cannot be wrested from us;—and, so far, it is endowed with an
absolute value in contrast to the merely relative worth of the other two. The
consequence of this is that it is much more difficult than people commonly
suppose to get a hold on a man from without. But here the all-powerful
agent, Time, comes in and claims its rights, and before its influence
physical and mental advantages gradually waste away. Moral character
alone remains inaccessible to it. In view of the destructive effect of time, it
seems, indeed, as if the blessings named under the other two heads, of
which time cannot directly rob us, were superior to those of the first.
Another advantage might be claimed for them, namely, that being in their
very nature objective and external, they are attainable, and every one is
presented with the possibility, at least, of coming into possession of them;
whilst what is subjective is not open to us to acquire, but making its entry
by a kind of divine right, it remains for life, immutable, inalienable, an
inexorable doom. Let me quote those lines in which Goethe describes how
an unalterable destiny is assigned to every man at the hour of his birth, so
that he can develop only in the lines laid down for him, as it were, by the
conjunctions of the stars: and how the Sybil and the prophets declare that
himself a man can never escape, nor any power of time avail to change the
path on which his life is cast

Wie an dem Tag, der dich der Welt verliehen,
Dïe Sonne stand zum Grusse der Planeten,
Bist alsobald und fort und fort gediehen,
Nach dem Gesetz, wonach du angetreten.
So musst du sein, dir kannst du nicht entfliehen,
So tagten schon Sybillen und Propheten;
Und keine Zeit, und keine Macht zerstückelt
Geprägte Form, die lebend sich entwickelt.

The only thing that stands in our power to achieve, is to make the most
advantageous use possible of the personal qualities we possess, and
accordingly to follow such pursuits only as will call them into play, to
strive after the kind of perfection of which they admit and to avoid every
other; consequently, to choose the position, occupation and manner of life
which are most suitable for their development.

Imagine a man endowed with herculean strength who is compelled by
circumstances to follow a sedentary occupation, some minute exquisite
work of the hands, for example, or to engage in study and mental labor
demanding quite other powers, and just those which he has not got,—
compelled, that is, to leave unused the powers in which he is pre-eminently
strong; a man placed like this will never feel happy all his life through.
Even more miserable will be the lot of the man with intellectual powers of
a very high order, who has to leave them undeveloped and unemployed, in
the pursuit of a calling which does not require them, some bodily labor,
perhaps, for which his strength is insufficient. Still, in a case of this kind, it
should be our care, especially in youth, to avoid the precipice of
presumption, and not ascribe to ourselves a superfluity of power which is
not there.

Since the blessings described under the first head decidedly outweigh
those contained under the other two, it is manifestly a wiser course to aim
at the maintenance of our health and the cultivation of our faculties, than at
the amassing of wealth; but this must not be mistaken as meaning that we
should neglect to acquire an adequate supply of the necessaries of life.
Wealth, in the strict sense of the word, that is, great superfluity, can do
little for our happiness; and many rich people feel unhappy just because
they are without any true mental culture or knowledge, and consequently
have no objective interests which would qualify them for intellectual
occupations. For beyond the satisfaction of some real and natural
necessities, all that the possession of wealth can achieve has a very small
influence upon our happiness, in the proper sense of the word; indeed,
wealth rather disturbs it, because the preservation of property entails a
great many unavoidable anxieties. And still men are a thousand times
more intent on becoming rich than on acquiring culture, though it is quite
certain that what a manis contributes much more to his happiness than
what he has. So you may see many a man, as industrious as an ant,
ceaselessly occupied from morning to night in the endeavor to increase his
heap of gold. Beyond the narrow horizon of means to this end, he knows
nothing; his mind is a blank, and consequently unsusceptible to any other
influence. The highest pleasures, those of the intellect, are to him
inaccessible, and he tries in vain to replace them by the fleeting pleasures of
sense in which he indulges, lasting but a brief hour and at tremendous cost.
And if he is lucky, his struggles result in his having a really great pile of
gold, which he leaves to his heir, either to make it still larger, or to
squander it in extravagance. A life like this, though pursued with a sense of
earnestness and an air of importance, is just as silly as many another which
has a fool's cap for its symbol.

What a man has in himself is, then, the chief element in his happiness.
Because this is, as a rule, so very little, most of those who are placed
beyond the struggle with penury feel at bottom quite as unhappy as those
who are still engaged in it. Their minds are vacant, their imagination dull,
their spirits poor, and so they are driven to the company of those like
them—for similis simili gaudet—where they make common pursuit of
pastime and entertainment, consisting for the most part in sensual
pleasure, amusement of every kind, and finally, in excess and libertinism.
A young man of rich family enters upon life with a large patrimony, and
often runs through it in an incredibly short space of time, in vicious
extravagance; and why? Simply because, here too, the mind is empty and
void, and so the man is bored with existence. He was sent forth into the
world outwardly rich but inwardly poor, and his vain endeavor was to
make his external wealth compensate for his inner poverty, by trying to
obtain everything from without, like an old man who seeks to strengthen
himself as King David or Maréchal de Rex tried to do. And so in the end
one who is inwardly poor comes to be also poor outwardly.

I need not insist upon the importance of the other two kinds of blessings
which make up the happiness of human life; now-a-days the value of
possessing them is too well known to require advertisement. The third
class, it is true, may seem, compared with the second, of a very ethereal
character, as it consists only of other people's opinions. Still every one has
to strive for reputation, that is to say, a good name. Rank, on the other
hand, should be aspired to only by those who serve the state, and fame by
very few indeed. In any case, reputation is looked upon as a priceless
treasure, and fame as the most precious of all the blessings a man can
attain,—the Golden Fleece, as it were, of the elect: whilst only fools will
prefer rank to property. The second and third classes, moreover, are
reciprocally cause and effect; so far, that is, as Petronius' maxim, habes
habeberis, is true; and conversely, the favor of others, in all its forms, often
puts us in the way of getting what we want.

## CHAPTER II.
PERSONALITY, OR WHAT A MAN IS.
We have already seen, in general, that what a man is contributes much
more to his happiness than what he has, or how he is regarded by others.
What a man is, and so what he has in his own person, is always the chief
thing to consider; for his individuality accompanies him always and
everywhere, and gives its color to all his experiences. In every kind of
enjoyment, for instance, the pleasure depends principally upon the man
himself. Every one admits this in regard to physical, and how much truer it
is of intellectual, pleasure. When we use that English expression, "to enjoy
one's self," we are employing a very striking and appropriate phrase; for
observe—one says, not "he enjoys Paris," but "he enjoys himself in Paris."
To a man possessed of an ill-conditioned individuality, all pleasure is like
delicate wine in a mouth made bitter with gall. Therefore, in the blessings
as well as in the ills of life, less depends upon what befalls us than upon the
way in which it is met, that is, upon the kind and degree of our general
susceptibility. What a man is and has in himself,—in a word personality,
with all it entails, is the only immediate and direct factor in his happiness
and welfare. All else is mediate and indirect, and its influence can be
neutralized and frustrated; but the influence of personality never. This is
why the envy which personal qualities excite is the most implacable of
all,—as it is also the most carefully dissembled.

Further, the constitution of our consciousness is the ever present and
lasting element in all we do or suffer; our individuality is persistently at
work, more or less, at every moment of our life: all other influences are
temporal, incidental, fleeting, and subject to every kind of chance and
change. This is why Aristotle says: It is not wealth but character that lasts.

[Greek: —hae gar phusis bebion ou ta chraemata]

And just for the same reason we can more easily bear a misfortune which
comes to us entirely from without, than one which we have drawn upon
ourselves; for fortune may always change, but not character. Therefore,
subjective blessings,—a noble nature, a capable head, a joyful
temperament, bright spirits, a well-constituted, perfectly sound physique,
in a word,mens sana in corpore sano, are the first and most important
elements in happiness; so that we should be more intent on promoting and
preserving such qualities than on the possession of external wealth and
external honor.

And of all these, the one which makes us the most directly happy is a
genial flow of good spirits; for this excellent quality is its own immediate
reward. The man who is cheerful and merry has always a good reason for
being so,—the fact, namely, that he is so. There is nothing which, like this
quality, can so completely replace the loss of every other blessing. If you
know anyone who is young, handsome, rich and esteemed, and you want
to know, further, if he is happy, ask, Is he cheerful and genial?—and if he
is, what does it matter whether he is young or old, straight or humpbacked,
poor or rich?—he is happy. In my early days I once opened an old book
and found these words: If you laugh a great deal, you are happy; if you cry
a great deal, you are unhappy;—a very simple remark, no doubt; but just
because it is so simple I have never been able to forget it, even though it is
in the last degree a truism. So if cheerfulness knocks at our door, we should
throw it wide open, for it never comes inopportunely; instead of that, we
often make scruples about letting it in. We want to be quite sure that we
have every reason to be contented; then we are afraid that cheerfulness of
spirits may interfere with serious reflections or weighty cares. Cheerfulness
is a direct and immediate gain,—the very coin, as it were, of happiness, and
not, like all else, merely a cheque upon the bank; for it alone makes us
immediately happy in the present moment, and that is the highest blessing
for beings like us, whose existence is but an infinitesimal moment between
two eternities. To secure and promote this feeling of cheerfulness should be
the supreme aim of all our endeavors after happiness.

Now it is certain that nothing contributes so little to cheerfulness as riches,
or so much, as health. Is it not in the lower classes, the so-called working
classes, more especially those of them who live in the country, that we see
cheerful and contented faces? and is it not amongst the rich, the upper
classes, that we find faces full of ill-humor and vexation? Consequently we
should try as much as possible to maintain a high degree of health; for
cheerfulness is the very flower of it. I need hardly say what one must do to
be healthy—avoid every kind of excess, all violent and unpleasant emotion,
all mental overstrain, take daily exercise in the open air, cold baths and
such like hygienic measures. For without a proper amount of daily exercise
no one can remain healthy; all the processes of life demand exercise for the
due performance of their functions, exercise not only of the parts more
immediately concerned, but also of the whole body. For, as Aristotle
rightly says, Life is movement; it is its very essence. Ceaseless and rapid
motion goes on in every part of the organism. The heart, with its
complicated double systole and diastole, beats strongly and untiringly;
with twenty-eight beats it has to drive the whole of the blood through
arteries, veins and capillaries; the lungs pump like a steam-engine, without
intermission; the intestines are always in peristaltic action; the glands are
all constantly absorbing and secreting; even the brain has a double motion
of its own, with every beat of the pulse and every breath we draw. When
people can get no exercise at all, as is the case with the countless numbers
who are condemned to a sedentary life, there is a glaring and fatal
disproportion between outward inactivity and inner tumult. For this
ceaseless internal motion requires some external counterpart, and the want
of it produces effects like those of emotion which we are obliged to
suppress. Even trees must be shaken by the wind, if they are to thrive. The
rule which finds its application here may be most briefly expressed in
Latin: omnis motus, quo celerior, eo magis motus.

How much our happiness depends upon our spirits, and these again upon
our state of health, may be seen by comparing the influence which the
same external circumstances or events have upon us when we are well and
strong with the effects which they have when we are depressed and
troubled with ill-health. It is not what things are objectively and in
themselves, but what they are for us, in our way of looking at them, that
makes us happy or the reverse. As Epictetus says, Men are not influenced
by things, but by their thoughts about things. And, in general, nine-tenths
of our happiness depends upon health alone. With health, everything is a
source of pleasure; without it, nothing else, whatever it may be, is
enjoyable; even the other personal blessings,—a great mind, a happy
temperament—are degraded and dwarfed for want of it. So it is really with
good reason that, when two people meet, the first thing they do is to
inquire after each other's health, and to express the hope that it is good; for
good health is by far the most important element in human happiness. It
follows from all this that the greatest of follies is to sacrifice health for any
other kind of happiness, whatever it may be, for gain, advancement,
learning or fame, let alone, then, for fleeting sensual pleasures. Everything
else should rather be postponed to it.

But however much health may contribute to that flow of good spirits which
is so essential to our happiness, good spirits do not entirely depend upon
health; for a man may be perfectly sound in his physique and still possess a
melancholy temperament and be generally given up to sad thoughts. The
ultimate cause of this is undoubtedly to be found in innate, and therefore
unalterable, physical constitution, especially in the more or less normal
relation of a man's sensitiveness to his muscular and vital energy.
Abnormal sensitiveness produces inequality of spirits, a predominating
melancholy, with periodical fits of unrestrained liveliness. A genius is one
whose nervous power or sensitiveness is largely in excess; as Aristotle has
very correctly observed, Men distinguished in philosophy, politics, poetry
or art appear to be all of a melancholy temperament. This is doubtless the
passage which Cicero has in his mind when he says, as he often does,
Aristoteles ait omnes ingeniosos melancholicos esse. Shakespeare has very
neatly expressed this radical and innate diversity of temperament in those
lines in The Merchant of Venice:
Nature has framed strange fellows in her time;
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,
And laugh, like parrots at a bag-piper;
And others of such vinegar aspect,
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

This is the difference which Plato draws between [Greek: eukolos] and
[Greek: dyskolos]—the man of easy, and the man of difficult disposition—
in proof of which he refers to the varying degrees of susceptibility which
different people show to pleasurable and painful impressions; so that one
man will laugh at what makes another despair. As a rule, the stronger the
susceptibility to unpleasant impressions, the weaker is the susceptibility to
pleasant ones, and vice versa. If it is equally possible for an event to turn
out well or ill, the [Greek: dyskolos] will be annoyed or grieved if the issue
is unfavorable, and will not rejoice, should it be happy. On the other hand,
the [Greek: eukolos] will neither worry nor fret over an unfavorable issue,
but rejoice if it turns out well. If the one is successful in nine out of ten
undertakings, he will not be pleased, but rather annoyed that one has
miscarried; whilst the other, if only a single one succeeds, will manage to
find consolation in the fact and remain cheerful. But here is another
instance of the truth, that hardly any evil is entirely without its
compensation; for the misfortunes and sufferings which the [Greek:
auskoloi], that is, people of gloomy and anxious character, have to
overcome, are, on the whole, more imaginary and therefore less real than
those which befall the gay and careless; for a man who paints everything
black, who constantly fears the worst and takes measures accordingly, will
not be disappointed so often in this world, as one who always looks upon
the bright side of things. And when a morbid affection of the nerves, or a
derangement of the digestive organs, plays into the hands of an innate
tendency to gloom, this tendency may reach such a height that permanent
discomfort produces a weariness of life. So arises an inclination to suicide,
which even the most trivial unpleasantness may actually bring about; nay,
when the tendency attains its worst form, it may be occasioned by nothing
in particular, but a man may resolve to put an end to his existence, simply
because he is permanently unhappy, and then coolly and firmly carry out
his determination; as may be seen by the way in which the sufferer, when
placed under supervision, as he usually is, eagerly waits to seize the first
unguarded moment, when, without a shudder, without a struggle or recoil,
he may use the now natural and welcome means of effecting his release.
Even the healthiest, perhaps even the most cheerful man, may resolve upon
death under certain circumstances; when, for instance, his sufferings, or his
fears of some inevitable misfortune, reach such a pitch as to outweigh the
terrors of death. The only difference lies in the degree of suffering
necessary to bring about the fatal act, a degree which will be high in the
case of a cheerful, and low in that of a gloomy man. The greater the
melancholy, the lower need the degree be; in the end, it may even sink to
zero. But if a man is cheerful, and his spirits are supported by good health,
it requires a high degree of suffering to make him lay hands upon himself.
There are countless steps in the scale between the two extremes of suicide,
the suicide which springs merely from a morbid intensification of innate
gloom, and the suicide of the healthy and cheerful man, who has entirely
objective grounds for putting an end to his existence.

Beauty is partly an affair of health. It may be reckoned as a personal
advantage; though it does not, properly speaking, contribute directly to our
happiness. It does so indirectly, by impressing other people; and it is no
unimportant advantage, even in man. Beauty is an open letter of
recommendation, predisposing the heart to favor the person who presents
it. As is well said in these lines of Homer, the gift of beauty is not lightly to
be thrown away, that glorious gift which none can bestow save the gods
alone—
[Greek: outoi hapoblaet erti theon erikuoea dora, ossa ken autoi dosin,
ekon douk an tis eloito].

The most general survey shows us that the two foes of human happiness
are pain and boredom. We may go further, and say that in the degree in
which we are fortunate enough to get away from the one, we approach the
other. Life presents, in fact, a more or less violent oscillation between the
two. The reason of this is that each of these two poles stands in a double
antagonism to the other, external or objective, and inner or subjective.
Needy surroundings and poverty produce pain; while, if a man is more
than well off, he is bored. Accordingly, while the lower classes are engaged
in a ceaseless struggle with need, in other words, with pain, the upper
carry on a constant and often desperate battle with boredom. The inner or
subjective antagonism arises from the fact that, in the individual,
susceptibility to pain varies inversely with susceptibility to boredom,
because susceptibility is directly proportionate to mental power. Let me
explain. A dull mind is, as a rule, associated with dull sensibilities, nerves
which no stimulus can affect, a temperament, in short, which does not feel
pain or anxiety very much, however great or terrible it may be. Now,
intellectual dullness is at the bottom of that vacuity of soul which is
stamped on so many faces, a state of mind which betrays itself by a
constant and lively attention to all the trivial circumstances in the external
world. This is the true source of boredom—a continual panting after
excitement, in order to have a pretext for giving the mind and spirits
something to occupy them. The kind of things people choose for this
purpose shows that they are not very particular, as witness the miserable
pastimes they have recourse to, and their ideas of social pleasure and
conversation: or again, the number of people who gossip on the doorstep
or gape out of the window. It is mainly because of this inner vacuity of soul
that people go in quest of society, diversion, amusement, luxury of every
sort, which lead many to extravagance and misery. Nothing is so good a
protection against such misery as inward wealth, the wealth of the mind,
because the greater it grows, the less room it leaves for boredom. The
inexhaustible activity of thought! Finding ever new material to work upon
in the multifarious phenomena of self and nature, and able and ready to
form new combinations of them,—there you have something that
invigorates the mind, and apart from moments of relaxation, sets it far
above the reach of boredom.

But, on the other hand, this high degree of intelligence is rooted in a high
degree of susceptibility, greater strength of will, greater passionateness;
and from the union of these qualities comes an increased capacity for
emotion, an enhanced sensibility to all mental and even bodily pain,
greater impatience of obstacles, greater resentment of interruption;—all of
which tendencies are augmented by the power of the imagination, the
vivid character of the whole range of thought, including what is
disagreeable. This applies, in various degrees, to every step in the long
scale of mental power, from the veriest dunce to the greatest genius that
ever lived. Therefore the nearer anyone is, either from a subjective or from
an objective point of view, to one of those sources of suffering in human
life, the farther he is from the other. And so a man's natural bent will lead
him to make his objective world conform to his subjective as much as
possible; that is to say, he will take the greatest measures against that form
of suffering to which he is most liable. The wise man will, above all, strive
after freedom from pain and annoyance, quiet and leisure, consequently a
tranquil, modest life, with as few encounters as may be; and so, after a little
experience of his so-called fellowmen, he will elect to live in retirement, or
even, if he is a man of great intellect, in solitude. For the more a man has in
himself, the less he will want from other people,—the less, indeed, other
people can be to him. This is why a high degree of intellect tends to make a
man unsocial. True, if quality of intellect could be made up for by quantity,
it might be worth while to live even in the great world; but unfortunately, a
hundred fools together will not make one wise man.

But the individual who stands at the other end of the scale is no sooner free
from the pangs of need than he endeavors to get pastime and society at any
cost, taking up with the first person he meets, and avoiding nothing so
much as himself. For in solitude, where every one is thrown upon his own
resources, what a man has in himself comes to light; the fool in fine raiment
groans under the burden of his miserable personality, a burden which he
can never throw off, whilst the man of talent peoples the waste places with
his animating thoughts. Seneca declares that folly is its own burden,—
omnis stultitia laborat fastidio sui,—a very true saying, with which may be
compared the words of Jesus, the son of Sirach, The life of a fool is worse
than death. And, as a rule, it will be found that a man is sociable just in the
degree in which he is intellectually poor and generally vulgar. For one's
choice in this world does not go much beyond solitude on one side and
vulgarity on the other. It is said that the most sociable of all people are the
negroes; and they are at the bottom of the scale in intellect. I remember
reading once in a French paper that the blacks in North America, whether
free or enslaved, are fond of shutting themselves up in large numbers in
the smallest space, because they cannot have too much of one another's
snub-nosed company.

The brain may be regarded as a kind of parasite of the organism, a
pensioner, as it were, who dwells with the body: and leisure, that is, the
time one has for the free enjoyment of one's consciousness or individuality,
is the fruit or produce of the rest of existence, which is in general only labor
and effort. But what does most people's leisure yield?—boredom and
dullness; except, of course, when it is occupied with sensual pleasure or
folly. How little such leisure is worth may be seen in the way in which it is
spent: and, as Ariosto observes, how miserable are the idle hours of
ignorant men!—ozio lungo d'uomini ignoranti. Ordinary people think
merely how they shall spend their time; a man of any talent tries to use it.
The reason why people of limited intellect are apt to be bored is that their
intellect is absolutely nothing more than the means by which the motive
power of the will is put into force: and whenever there is nothing particular
to set the will in motion, it rests, and their intellect takes a holiday, because,
equally with the will, it requires something external to bring it into play.
The result is an awful stagnation of whatever power a man has—in a word,
boredom. To counteract this miserable feeling, men run to trivialities which
please for the moment they are taken up, hoping thus to engage the will in
order to rouse it to action, and so set the intellect in motion; for it is the
latter which has to give effect to these motives of the will. Compared with
real and natural motives, these are but as paper money to coin; for their
value is only arbitrary—card games and the like, which have been invented
for this very purpose. And if there is nothing else to be done, a man will
twirl his thumbs or beat the devil's tattoo; or a cigar may be a welcome
substitute for exercising his brains. Hence, in all countries the chief
occupation of society is card-playing, and it is the gauge of its value, and
an outward sign that it is bankrupt in thought. Because people have no
thoughts to deal in, they deal cards, and try and win one another's money.
Idiots! But I do not wish to be unjust; so let me remark that it may certainly
be said in defence of card-playing that it is a preparation for the world and
for business life, because one learns thereby how to make a clever use of
fortuitous but unalterable circumstances (cards, in this case), and to get as
much out of them as one can: and to do this a man must learn a little
dissimulation, and how to put a good face upon a bad business. But, on the
other hand, it is exactly for this reason that card-playing is so demoralizing,
since the whole object of it is to employ every kind of trick and
machination in order to win what belongs to another. And a habit of this
sort, learnt at the card-table, strikes root and pushes its way into practical
life; and in the affairs of every day a man gradually comes to regard meum
and tuum in much the same light as cards, and to consider that he may use
to the utmost whatever advantages he possesses, so long as he does not
come within the arm of the law. Examples of what I mean are of daily
occurrence in mercantile life. Since, then, leisure is the flower, or rather the
fruit, of existence, as it puts a man into possession of himself, those are
happy indeed who possess something real in themselves. But what do you
get from most people's leisure?—only a good-for-nothing fellow, who is
terribly bored and a burden to himself. Let us, therefore, rejoice, dear
brethren, for we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
Further, as no land is so well off as that which requires few imports, or
none at all, so the happiest man is one who has enough in his own inner
wealth, and requires little or nothing from outside for his maintenance, for
imports are expensive things, reveal dependence, entail danger, occasion
trouble, and when all is said and done, are a poor substitute for home
produce. No man ought to expect much from others, or, in general, from
the external world. What one human being can be to another is not a very
great deal: in the end every one stands alone, and the important thing is
who it is that stands alone. Here, then, is another application of the general
truth which Goethe recognizes in Dichtung und Wahrheit (Bk. III.), that in
everything a man has ultimately to appeal to himself; or, as Goldsmith puts
it in The Traveller:
Still to ourselves in every place consign'd Our own felicity we make or
find.

Himself is the source of the best and most a man can be or achieve. The
more this is so—the more a man finds his sources of pleasure in himself—
the happier he will be. Therefore, it is with great truth that Aristotle says,
To be happy means to be self-sufficient. For all other sources of happiness
are in their nature most uncertain, precarious, fleeting, the sport of chance;
and so even under the most favorable circumstances they can easily be
exhausted; nay, this is unavoidable, because they are not always within
reach. And in old age these sources of happiness must necessarily dry
up:—love leaves us then, and wit, desire to travel, delight in horses,
aptitude for social intercourse; friends and relations, too, are taken from us
by death. Then more than ever, it depends upon what a man has in
himself; for this will stick to him longest; and at any period of life it is the
only genuine and lasting source of happiness. There is not much to be got
anywhere in the world. It is filled with misery and pain; and if a man
escapes these, boredom lies in wait for him at every corner. Nay more; it is
evil which generally has the upper hand, and folly makes the most noise.
Fate is cruel, and mankind is pitiable. In such a world as this, a man who is
rich in himself is like a bright, warm, happy room at Christmastide, while
without are the frost and snow of a December night. Therefore, without
doubt, the happiest destiny on earth is to have the rare gift of a rich
individuality, and, more especially to be possessed of a good endowment
of intellect; this is the happiest destiny, though it may not be, after all, a
very brilliant one.

There was a great wisdom in that remark which Queen Christina of
Sweden made, in her nineteenth year, about Descartes, who had then lived
for twenty years in the deepest solitude in Holland, and, apart from report,
was known to her only by a single essay: M. Descartes, she said, is the
happiest of men, and his condition seems to me much to be envied. Of
course, as was the case with Descartes, external circumstances must be
favorable enough to allow a man to be master of his life and happiness; or,
as we read in Ecclesiastes—Wisdom is good together with an inheritance,
and profitable unto them that see the sun. The man to whom nature and
fate have granted the blessing of wisdom, will be most anxious and careful
to keep open the fountains of happiness which he has in himself; and for
this, independence and leisure are necessary. To obtain them, he will be
willing to moderate his desires and harbor his resources, all the more
because he is not, like others, restricted to the external world for his
pleasures. So he will not be misled by expectations of office, or money, or
the favor and applause of his fellowmen, into surrendering himself in
order to conform to low desires and vulgar tastes; nay, in such a case he
will follow the advice that Horace gives in his epistle to Maecenas.
Nec somnum plebis laudo, satur altilium, nec Otia divitiis Arabum
liberrima muto.

It is a great piece of folly to sacrifice the inner for the outer man, to give the
whole or the greater part of one's quiet, leisure and independence for
splendor, rank, pomp, titles and honor. This is what Goethe did. My good
luck drew me quite in the other direction.
The truth which I am insisting upon here, the truth, namely, that the chief
source of human happiness is internal, is confirmed by that most accurate
observation of Aristotle in theNichomachean Ethics that every pleasure
presupposes some sort of activity, the application of some sort of power,
without which it cannot exist. The doctrine of Aristotle's, that a man's
happiness consists in the free exercise of his highest faculties, is also
enunciated by Stobaeus in his exposition of the Peripatetic philosophy:
happiness, he says, means vigorous and successful activity in all your
undertakings; and he explains that by vigor [Greek: aretae] he means
mastery in any thing, whatever it be. Now, the original purpose of those
forces with which nature has endowed man is to enable him to struggle
against the difficulties which beset him on all sides. But if this struggle
comes to an end, his unemployed forces become a burden to him; and he
has to set to work and play with them,—to use them, I mean, for no
purpose at all, beyond avoiding the other source of human suffering,
boredom, to which he is at once exposed. It is the upper classes, people of
wealth, who are the greatest victims of boredom. Lucretius long ago
described their miserable state, and the truth of his description may be still
recognized to-day, in the life of every great capital—where the rich man is
seldom in his own halls, because it bores him to be there, and still he
returns thither, because he is no better off outside;—or else he is away in
post-haste to his house in the country, as if it were on fire; and he is no
sooner arrived there, than he is bored again, and seeks to forget everything
in sleep, or else hurries back to town once more.

Exit saepe foras magnis ex aedibus ille,
Esse domi quem pertaesum est, subitoque reventat,
Quippe foris nihilo melius qui sentiat esse.
Currit, agens mannos, ad villam precipitanter,
Auxilium tectis quasi ferre ardentibus instans:
Oscitat extemplo, tetigit quum limina villae;
Aut abit in somnum gravis, atque oblivia quaerit;
Aut etiam properans urbem petit atque revisit.

In their youth, such people must have had a superfluity of muscular and
vital energy,—powers which, unlike those of the mind, cannot maintain
their full degree of vigor very long; and in later years they either have no
mental powers at all, or cannot develop any for want of employment which
would bring them into play; so that they are in a wretched plight. Will,
however, they still possess, for this is the only power that is inexhaustible;
and they try to stimulate their will by passionate excitement, such as games
of chance for high stakes—undoubtedly a most degrading form of vice.
And one may say generally that if a man finds himself with nothing to do,
he is sure to choose some amusement suited to the kind of power in which
he excels,—bowls, it may be, or chess; hunting or painting; horse-racing or
music; cards, or poetry, heraldry, philosophy, or some other dilettante
interest. We might classify these interests methodically, by reducing them
to expressions of the three fundamental powers, the factors, that is to say,
which go to make up the physiological constitution of man; and further, by
considering these powers by themselves, and apart from any of the definite
aims which they may subserve, and simply as affording three sources of
possible pleasure, out of which every man will choose what suits him,
according as he excels in one direction or another.

First of all come the pleasures of vital energy, of food, drink, digestion, rest
and sleep; and there are parts of the world where it can be said that these
are characteristic and national pleasures. Secondly, there are the pleasures
of muscular energy, such as walking, running, wrestling, dancing, fencing,
riding and similar athletic pursuits, which sometimes take the form of
sport, and sometimes of a military life and real warfare. Thirdly, there are
the pleasures of sensibility, such as observation, thought, feeling, or a taste
for poetry or culture, music, learning, reading, meditation, invention,
philosophy and the like. As regards the value, relative worth and duration
of each of these kinds of pleasure, a great deal might be said, which,
however, I leave the reader to supply. But every one will see that the nobler
the power which is brought into play, the greater will be the pleasure
which it gives; for pleasure always involves the use of one's own powers,
and happiness consists in a frequent repetition of pleasure. No one will
deny that in this respect the pleasures of sensibility occupy a higher place
than either of the other two fundamental kinds; which exist in an equal,
nay, in a greater degree in brutes; it is this preponderating amount of
sensibility which distinguishes man from other animals. Now, our mental
powers are forms of sensibility, and therefore a preponderating amount of
it makes us capable of that kind of pleasure which has to do with mind, socalled
intellectual pleasure; and the more sensibility predominates, the
greater the pleasure will be.

The normal, ordinary man takes a vivid interest in anything only in so far
as it excites his will, that is to say, is a matter of personal interest to him.
But constant excitement of the will is never an unmixed good, to say the
least; in other words, it involves pain. Card-playing, that universal
occupation of "good society" everywhere, is a device for providing this
kind of excitement, and that, too, by means of interests so small as to
produce slight and momentary, instead of real and permanent, pain. Cardplaying
is, in fact, a mere tickling of the will.

On the other hand, a man of powerful intellect is capable of taking a vivid
interest in things in the way of mere knowledge, with no admixture of will;
nay, such an interest is a necessity to him. It places him in a sphere where
pain is an alien,—a diviner air, where the gods live serene.
[Greek: phusis bebion ou ta chraematatheoi reia xoontes]
Look on these two pictures—the life of the masses, one long, dull record of
struggle and effort entirely devoted to the petty interests of personal
welfare, to misery in all its forms, a life beset by intolerable boredom as
soon as ever those aims are satisfied and the man is thrown back upon
himself, whence he can be roused again to some sort of movement only by
the wild fire of passion. On the other side you have a man endowed with a
high degree of mental power, leading an existence rich in thought and full
of life and meaning, occupied by worthy and interesting objects as soon as
ever he is free to give himself to them, bearing in himself a source of the
noblest pleasure. What external promptings he wants come from the works
of nature, and from the contemplation of human affairs and the
achievements of the great of all ages and countries, which are thoroughly
appreciated by a man of this type alone, as being the only one who can
quite understand and feel with them. And so it is for him alone that those
great ones have really lived; it is to him that they make their appeal; the
rest are but casual hearers who only half understand either them or their
followers. Of course, this characteristic of the intellectual man implies that
he has one more need than the others, the need of reading, observing,
studying, meditating, practising, the need, in short, of undisturbed leisure.
For, as Voltaire has very rightly said, there are no real pleasures without
real needs; and the need of them is why to such a man pleasures are
accessible which are denied to others,—the varied beauties of nature and
art and literature. To heap these pleasures round people who do not want
them and cannot appreciate them, is like expecting gray hairs to fall in love.
A man who is privileged in this respect leads two lives, a personal and an
intellectual life; and the latter gradually comes to be looked upon as the
true one, and the former as merely a means to it. Other people make this
shallow, empty and troubled existence an end in itself. To the life of the
intellect such a man will give the preference over all his other occupations:
by the constant growth of insight and knowledge, this intellectual life, like
a slowly-forming work of art, will acquire a consistency, a permanent
intensity, a unity which becomes ever more and more complete; compared
with which, a life devoted to the attainment of personal comfort, a life that
may broaden indeed, but can never be deepened, makes but a poor show:
and yet, as I have said, people make this baser sort of existence an end in
itself.

The ordinary life of every day, so far as it is not moved by passion, is
tedious and insipid; and if it is so moved, it soon becomes painful. Those
alone are happy whom nature has favored with some superfluity of
intellect, something beyond what is just necessary to carry out the behests
of their will; for it enables them to lead an intellectual life as well, a life
unattended by pain and full of vivid interests. Mere leisure, that is to say,
intellect unoccupied in the service of the will, is not of itself sufficient: there
must be a real superfluity of power, set free from the service of the will and
devoted to that of the intellect; for, as Seneca says, otium sine litteris mors
est et vivi hominis sepultura—illiterate leisure is a form of death, a living
tomb. Varying with the amount of the superfluity, there will be countless
developments in this second life, the life of the mind; it may be the mere
collection and labelling of insects, birds, minerals, coins, or the highest
achievements of poetry and philosophy. The life of the mind is not only a
protection against boredom; it also wards off the pernicious effects of
boredom; it keeps us from bad company, from the many dangers,
misfortunes, losses and extravagances which the man who places his
happiness entirely in the objective world is sure to encounter, My
philosophy, for instance, has never brought me in a six-pence; but it has
spared me many an expense.

The ordinary man places his life's happiness in things external to him, in
property, rank, wife and children, friends, society, and the like, so that
when he loses them or finds them disappointing, the foundation of his
happiness is destroyed. In other words, his centre of gravity is not in
himself; it is constantly changing its place, with every wish and whim. If he
is a man of means, one day it will be his house in the country, another
buying horses, or entertaining friends, or traveling,—a life, in short, of
general luxury, the reason being that he seeks his pleasure in things outside
him. Like one whose health and strength are gone, he tries to regain by the
use of jellies and drugs, instead of by developing his own vital power, the
true source of what he has lost. Before proceeding to the opposite, let us
compare with this common type the man who comes midway between the
two, endowed, it may be, not exactly with distinguished powers of mind,
but with somewhat more than the ordinary amount of intellect. He will
take a dilettante interest in art, or devote his attention to some branch of
science—botany, for example, or physics, astronomy, history, and find a
great deal of pleasure in such studies, and amuse himself with them when
external forces of happiness are exhausted or fail to satisfy him any more.
Of a man like this it may be said that his centre of gravity is partly in
himself. But a dilettante interest in art is a very different thing from
creative activity; and an amateur pursuit of science is apt to be superficial
and not to penetrate to the heart of the matter. A man cannot entirely
identify himself with such pursuits, or have his whole existence so
completely filled and permeated with them that he loses all interest in
everything else. It is only the highest intellectual power, what we call
genius, that attains to this degree of intensity, making all time and
existence its theme, and striving to express its peculiar conception of the
world, whether it contemplates life as the subject of poetry or of
philosophy. Hence, undisturbed occupation with himself, his own
thoughts and works, is a matter of urgent necessity to such a man; solitude
is welcome, leisure is the highest good, and everything else is unnecessary,
nay, even burdensome.

This is the only type of man of whom it can be said that his centre of
gravity is entirely in himself; which explains why it is that people of this
sort—and they are very rare—no matter how excellent their character may
be, do not show that warm and unlimited interest in friends, family, and
the community in general, of which others are so often capable; for if they
have only themselves they are not inconsolable for the loss of everything
else. This gives an isolation to their character, which is all the more
effective since other people never really quite satisfy them, as being, on the
whole, of a different nature: nay more, since this difference is constantly
forcing itself upon their notice they get accustomed to move about amongst
mankind as alien beings, and in thinking of humanity in general, to say
they instead of we.

So the conclusion we come to is that the man whom nature has endowed
with intellectual wealth is the happiest; so true it is that the subjective
concerns us more than the objective; for whatever the latter may be, it can
work only indirectly, secondly, and through the medium of the former—a
truth finely expressed by Lucian:—
[Greek: Aeloutos ho taes psychaes ploutus monos estin alaethaes
Talla dechei ataen pleiona ton kteanon—]

the wealth of the soul is the only true wealth, for with all other riches
comes a bane even greater than they. The man of inner wealth wants
nothing from outside but the negative gift of undisturbed leisure, to
develop and mature his intellectual faculties, that is, to enjoy his wealth; in
short, he wants permission to be himself, his whole life long, every day and
every hour. If he is destined to impress the character of his mind upon a
whole race, he has only one measure of happiness or unhappiness—to
succeed or fail in perfecting his powers and completing his work. All else is
of small consequence. Accordingly, the greatest minds of all ages have set
the highest value upon undisturbed leisure, as worth exactly as much as
the man himself. Happiness appears to consist in leisure, says Aristotle;
and Diogenes Laertius reports that Socrates praised leisure as the fairest of
all possessions. So, in theNichomachean Ethics, Aristotle concludes that a
life devoted to philosophy is the happiest; or, as he says in the Politics, the
free exercise of any power, whatever it may be, is happiness. This again,
tallies with what Goethe says in Wilhelm Meister: The man who is born
with a talent which he is meant to use, finds his greatest happiness in using
it.

But to be in possession of undisturbed leisure, is far from being the
common lot; nay, it is something alien to human nature, for the ordinary
man's destiny is to spend life in procuring what is necessary for the
subsistence of himself and his family; he is a son of struggle and need, not a
free intelligence. So people as a rule soon get tired of undisturbed leisure,
and it becomes burdensome if there are no fictitious and forced aims to
occupy it, play, pastime and hobbies of every kind. For this very reason it is
full of possible danger, and difficilis in otio quies is a true saying,—it is
difficult to keep quiet if you have nothing to do. On the other hand, a
measure of intellect far surpassing the ordinary, is as unnatural as it is
abnormal. But if it exists, and the man endowed with it is to be happy, he
will want precisely that undisturbed leisure which the others find
burdensome or pernicious; for without it he is a Pegasus in harness, and
consequently unhappy. If these two unnatural circumstances, external, and
internal, undisturbed leisure and great intellect, happen to coincide in the
same person, it is a great piece of fortune; and if the fate is so far favorable,
a man can lead the higher life, the life protected from the two opposite
sources of human suffering, pain and boredom, from the painful struggle
for existence, and the incapacity for enduring leisure (which is free
existence itself)—evils which may be escaped only by being mutually
neutralized.

But there is something to be said in opposition to this view. Great
intellectual gifts mean an activity pre-eminently nervous in its character,
and consequently a very high degree of susceptibility to pain in every
form. Further, such gifts imply an intense temperament, larger and more
vivid ideas, which, as the inseparable accompaniment of great intellectual
power, entail on its possessor a corresponding intensity of the emotions,
making them incomparably more violent than those to which the ordinary
man is a prey. Now, there are more things in the world productive of pain
than of pleasure. Again, a large endowment of intellect tends to estrange
the man who has it from other people and their doings; for the more a man
has in himself, the less he will be able to find in them; and the hundred
things in which they take delight, he will think shallow and insipid. Here,
then, perhaps, is another instance of that law of compensation which
makes itself felt everywhere. How often one hears it said, and said, too,
with some plausibility, that the narrow-minded man is at bottom the
happiest, even though his fortune is unenviable. I shall make no attempt to
forestall the reader's own judgment on this point; more especially as
Sophocles himself has given utterance to two diametrically opposite
opinions:—
[Greek: Pollo to phronein eudaimonias proton uparchei.]
he says in one place—wisdom is the greatest part of happiness; and again,
in another passage, he declares that the life of the thoughtless is the most
pleasant of all—
[Greek: En ta phronein gar maeden aedistos bios.]
The philosophers of the Old Testament find themselves in a like
contradiction.
The life of a fool is worse than death
and—
In much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge
increaseth sorrow.

I may remark, however, that a man who has no mental needs, because his
intellect is of the narrow and normal amount, is, in the strict sense of the
word, what is called a philistine—an expression at first peculiar to the
German language, a kind of slang term at the Universities, afterwards
used, by analogy, in a higher sense, though still in its original meaning, as
denoting one who is not a Son of the Muses. A philistine is and remains
[Greek: amousos anaer]. I should prefer to take a higher point of view, and
apply the term philistine to people who are always seriously occupied with
realities which are no realities; but as such a definition would be a
transcendental one, and therefore not generally intelligible, it would hardly
be in place in the present treatise, which aims at being popular. The other
definition can be more easily elucidated, indicating, as it does, satisfactorily
enough, the essential nature of all those qualities which distinguish the
philistine. He is defined to be a man without mental needs. From this is
follows, firstly, in relation to himself, that he has no intellectual pleasures;
for, as was remarked before, there are no real pleasures without real needs.
The philistine's life is animated by no desire to gain knowledge and insight
for their own sake, or to experience that true aeesthetic pleasure which is so
nearly akin to them. If pleasures of this kind are fashionable, and the
philistine finds himself compelled to pay attention to them, he will force
himself to do so, but he will take as little interest in them as possible. His
only real pleasures are of a sensual kind, and he thinks that these
indemnify him for the loss of the others. To him oysters and champagne
are the height of existence; the aim of his life is to procure what will
contribute to his bodily welfare, and he is indeed in a happy way if this
causes him some trouble. If the luxuries of life are heaped upon him, he
will inevitably be bored, and against boredom he has a great many fancied
remedies, balls, theatres, parties, cards, gambling, horses, women,
drinking, traveling and so on; all of which can not protect a man from
being bored, for where there are no intellectual needs, no intellectual
pleasures are possible. The peculiar characteristic of the philistine is a dull,
dry kind of gravity, akin to that of animals. Nothing really pleases, or
excites, or interests him, for sensual pleasure is quickly exhausted, and the
society of philistines soon becomes burdensome, and one may even get
tired of playing cards. True, the pleasures of vanity are left, pleasures
which he enjoys in his own way, either by feeling himself superior in point
of wealth, or rank, or influence and power to other people, who thereupon
pay him honor; or, at any rate, by going about with those who have a
superfluity of these blessings, sunning himself in the reflection of their
splendor—what the English call a snob.

From the essential nature of the philistine it follows, secondly, in regard to
others, that, as he possesses no intellectual, but only physical need, he will
seek the society of those who can satisfy the latter, but not the former. The
last thing he will expect from his friends is the possession of any sort of
intellectual capacity; nay, if he chances to meet with it, it will rouse his
antipathy and even hatred; simply because in addition to an unpleasant
sense of inferiority, he experiences, in his heart, a dull kind of envy, which
has to be carefully concealed even from himself. Nevertheless, it sometimes
grows into a secret feeling of rancor. But for all that, it will never occur to
him to make his own ideas of worth or value conform to the standard of
such qualities; he will continue to give the preference to rank and riches,
power and influence, which in his eyes seem to be the only genuine
advantages in the world; and his wish will be to excel in them himself. All
this is the consequence of his being a man without intellectual needs. The
great affliction of all philistines is that they have no interest in ideas, and
that, to escape being bored, they are in constant need of realities. But
realities are either unsatisfactory or dangerous; when they lose their
interest, they become fatiguing. But the ideal world is illimitable and calm,
something afar From the sphere of our sorrow.

## CHAPTER III.
PROPERTY, OR WHAT A MAN HAS.
Epicurus divides the needs of mankind into three classes, and the division
made by this great professor of happiness is a true and a fine one. First
come natural and necessary needs, such as, when not satisfied, produce
pain,—food and clothing, victus et amictus, needs which can easily be
satisfied. Secondly, there are those needs which, though natural, are not
necessary, such as the gratification of certain of the senses. I may add,
however, that in the report given by Diogenes Laertius, Epicurus does not
mention which of the senses he means; so that on this point my account of
his doctrine is somewhat more definite and exact than the original. These
are needs rather more difficult to satisfy. The third class consists of needs
which are neither natural nor necessary, the need of luxury and
prodigality, show and splendor, which never come to an end, and are very
hard to satisfy.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to define the limits which reason should
impose on the desire for wealth; for there is no absolute or definite amount
of wealth which will satisfy a man. The amount is always relative, that is to
say, just so much as will maintain the proportion between what he wants
and what he gets; for to measure a man's happiness only by what he gets,
and not also by what he expects to get, is as futile as to try and express a
fraction which shall have a numerator but no denominator. A man never
feels the loss of things which it never occurs to him to ask for; he is just as
happy without them; whilst another, who may have a hundred times as
much, feels miserable because he has not got the one thing he wants. In
fact, here too, every man has an horizon of his own, and he will expect as
much as he thinks it is possible for him to get. If an object within his
horizon looks as though he could confidently reckon on getting it, he is
happy; but if difficulties come in the way, he is miserable. What lies
beyond his horizon has no effect at all upon him. So it is that the vast
possessions of the rich do not agitate the poor, and conversely, that a
wealthy man is not consoled by all his wealth for the failure of his hopes.
Riches, one may say, are like sea-water; the more you drink the thirstier
you become; and the same is true of fame. The loss of wealth and
prosperity leaves a man, as soon as the first pangs of grief are over, in very
much the same habitual temper as before; and the reason of this is, that as
soon as fate diminishes the amount of his possessions, he himself
immediately reduces the amount of his claims. But when misfortune comes
upon us, to reduce the amount of our claims is just what is most painful;
once that we have done so, the pain becomes less and less, and is felt no
more; like an old wound which has healed. Conversely, when a piece of
good fortune befalls us, our claims mount higher and higher, as there is
nothing to regulate them; it is in this feeling of expansion that the delight of
it lies. But it lasts no longer than the process itself, and when the expansion
is complete, the delight ceases; we have become accustomed to the increase
in our claims, and consequently indifferent to the amount of wealth which
satisfies them. There is a passage in the Odyssey illustrating this truth, of
which I may quote the last two lines:
[Greek: Toios gar noos estin epichthonion anthropon
Oion eth aemar agei pataer andron te theou te]
—the thoughts of man that dwells on the earth are as the day granted him
by the father of gods and men. Discontent springs from a constant
endeavor to increase the amount of our claims, when we are powerless to
increase the amount which will satisfy them.
When we consider how full of needs the human race is, how its whole
existence is based upon them, it is not a matter for surprise that wealth is
held in more sincere esteem, nay, in greater honor, than anything else in
the world; nor ought we to wonder that gain is made the only good of life,
and everything that does not lead to it pushed aside or thrown
overboard—philosophy, for instance, by those who profess it. People are
often reproached for wishing for money above all things, and for loving it
more than anything else; but it is natural and even inevitable for people to
love that which, like an unwearied Proteus, is always ready to turn itself
into whatever object their wandering wishes or manifold desires may for
the moment fix upon. Everything else can satisfy only one wish, one need:
food is good only if you are hungry; wine, if you are able to enjoy it; drugs,
if you are sick; fur for the winter; love for youth, and so on. These are all
only relatively good, [Greek: agatha pros ti]. Money alone is absolutely
good, because it is not only a concrete satisfaction of one need in particular;
it is an abstract satisfaction of all.
If a man has an independent fortune, he should regard it as a bulwark
against the many evils and misfortunes which he may encounter; he should
not look upon it as giving him leave to get what pleasure he can out of the
world, or as rendering it incumbent upon him to spend it in this way.
People who are not born with a fortune, but end by making a large one
through the exercise of whatever talents they possess, almost always come
to think that their talents are their capital, and that the money they have
gained is merely the interest upon it; they do not lay by a part of their
earnings to form a permanent capital, but spend their money much as they
have earned it. Accordingly, they often fall into poverty; their earnings
decreased, or come to an end altogether, either because their talent is
exhausted by becoming antiquated,—as, for instance, very often happens
in the case of fine art; or else it was valid only under a special conjunction
of circumstances which has now passed away. There is nothing to prevent
those who live on the common labor of their hands from treating their
earnings in that way if they like; because their kind of skill is not likely to
disappear, or, if it does, it can be replaced by that of their fellow-workmen;
morever, the kind of work they do is always in demand; so that what the
proverb says is quite true, a useful trade is a mine of gold. But with artists
and professionals of every kind the case is quite different, and that is the
reason why they are well paid. They ought to build up a capital out of their
earnings; but they recklessly look upon them as merely interest, and end in
ruin. On the other hand, people who inherit money know, at least, how to
distinguish between capital and interest, and most of them try to make
their capital secure and not encroach upon it; nay, if they can, they put by
at least an eighth of their interests in order to meet future contingencies. So
most of them maintain their position. These few remarks about capital and
interest are not applicable to commercial life, for merchants look upon
money only as a means of further gain, just as a workman regards his tools;
so even if their capital has been entirely the result of their own efforts, they
try to preserve and increase it by using it. Accordingly, wealth is nowhere
so much at home as in the merchant class.
It will generally be found that those who know what it is to have been in
need and destitution are very much less afraid of it, and consequently more
inclined to extravagance, than those who know poverty only by hearsay.
People who have been born and bred in good circumstances are as a rule
much more careful about the future, more economical, in fact, than those
who, by a piece of good luck, have suddenly passed from poverty to
wealth. This looks as if poverty were not really such a very wretched thing
as it appears from a distance. The true reason, however, is rather the fact
that the man who has been born into a position of wealth comes to look
upon it as something without which he could no more live than he could
live without air; he guards it as he does his very life; and so he is generally
a lover of order, prudent and economical. But the man who has been born
into a poor position looks upon it as the natural one, and if by any chance
he comes in for a fortune, he regards it as a superfluity, something to be
enjoyed or wasted, because, if it comes to an end, he can get on just as well
as before, with one anxiety the less; or, as Shakespeare says in Henry VI.,
…. the adage must be verified That beggars mounted run their horse to
death.
But it should be said that people of this kind have a firm and excessive
trust, partly in fate, partly in the peculiar means which have already raised
them out of need and poverty,—a trust not only of the head, but of the
heart also; and so they do not, like the man born rich, look upon the
shallows of poverty as bottomless, but console themselves with the thought
that once they have touched ground again, they can take another upward
flight. It is this trait in human character which explains the fact that women
who were poor before their marriage often make greater claims, and are
more extravagant, than those who have brought their husbands a rich
dowry; because, as a rule, rich girls bring with them, not only a fortune, but
also more eagerness, nay, more of the inherited instinct, to preserve it, than
poor girls do. If anyone doubts the truth of this, and thinks that it is just the
opposite, he will find authority for his view in Ariosto's first Satire; but, on
the other hand, Dr. Johnson agrees with my opinion. A woman of fortune,
he says, being used to the handling of money, spends it judiciously; but a
woman who gets the command of money for the first time upon her
marriage, has such a gusto in spending it, that she throws it away with
great profusion. And in any case let me advise anyone who marries a poor
girl not to leave her the capital but only the interest, and to take especial
care that she has not the management of the children's fortune.
I do not by any means think that I am touching upon a subject which is not
worth my while to mention when I recommend people to be careful to
preserve what they have earned or inherited. For to start life with just as
much as will make one independent, that is, allow one to live comfortably
without having to work—even if one has only just enough for oneself, not
to speak of a family—is an advantage which cannot be over-estimated; for
it means exemption and immunity from that chronic disease of penury,
which fastens on the life of man like a plague; it is emancipation from that
forced labor which is the natural lot of every mortal. Only under a
favorable fate like this can a man be said to be born free, to be, in the
proper sense of the word, sui juris, master of his own time and powers, and
able to say every morning, This day is my own. And just for the same
reason the difference between the man who has a hundred a year and the
man who has a thousand, is infinitely smaller than the difference between
the former and a man who has nothing at all. But inherited wealth reaches
its utmost value when it falls to the individual endowed with mental
powers of a high order, who is resolved to pursue a line of life not
compatible with the making of money; for he is then doubly endowed by
fate and can live for his genius; and he will pay his debt to mankind a
hundred times, by achieving what no other could achieve, by producing
some work which contributes to the general good, and redounds to the
honor of humanity at large. Another, again, may use his wealth to further
philanthropic schemes, and make himself well-deserving of his fellowmen.
But a man who does none of these things, who does not even try to do
them, who never attempts to learn the rudiments of any branch of
knowledge so that he may at least do what he can towards promoting it—
such a one, born as he is into riches, is a mere idler and thief of time, a
contemptible fellow. He will not even be happy, because, in his case,
exemption from need delivers him up to the other extreme of human
suffering, boredom, which is such martyrdom to him, that he would have
been better off if poverty had given him something to do. And as he is
bored he is apt to be extravagant, and so lose the advantage of which he
showed himself unworthy. Countless numbers of people find themselves
in want, simply because, when they had money, they spent it only to get
momentary relief from the feeling of boredom which oppressed them.
It is quite another matter if one's object is success in political life, where
favor, friends and connections are all-important, in order to mount by their
aid step by step on the ladder of promotion, and perhaps gain the topmost
rung. In this kind of life, it is much better to be cast upon the world without
a penny; and if the aspirant is not of noble family, but is a man of some
talent, it will redound to his advantage to be an absolute pauper. For what
every one most aims at in ordinary contact with his fellows is to prove
them inferior to himself; and how much more is this the case in politics.
Now, it is only an absolute pauper who has such a thorough conviction of
his own complete, profound and positive inferiority from every point of
view, of his own utter insignificance and worthlessness, that he can take his
place quietly in the political machine. He is the only one who can keep on
bowing low enough, and even go right down upon his face if necessary; he
alone can submit to everything and laugh at it; he alone knows the entire
worthlessness of merit; he alone uses his loudest voice and his boldest type
whenever he has to speak or write of those who are placed over his head,
or occupy any position of influence; and if they do a little scribbling, he is
ready to applaud it as a masterwork. He alone understands how to beg,
and so betimes, when he is hardly out of his boyhood, he becomes a high
priest of that hidden mystery which Goethe brings to light.
Uber's Niederträchtige
Niemand sich beklage:
Denn es ist das Machtige
Was man dir auch sage:
—it is no use to complain of low aims; for, whatever people may say, they
rule the world.
On the other hand, the man who is born with enough to live upon is
generally of a somewhat independent turn of mind; he is accustomed to
keep his head up; he has not learned all the arts of the beggar; perhaps he
even presumes a little upon the possession of talents which, as he ought to
know, can never compete with cringing mediocrity; in the long run he
comes to recognize the inferiority of those who are placed over his head,
and when they try to put insults upon him, he becomes refractory and shy.
This is not the way to get on in the world. Nay, such a man may at least
incline to the opinion freely expressed by Voltaire: We have only two days
to live; it is not worth our while to spend them in cringing to contemptible
rascals. But alas! let me observe by the way, that contemptible rascal is an
attribute which may be predicated of an abominable number of people.
What Juvenal says—it is difficult to rise if your poverty is greater than your
talent—
Haud facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat
Res angusta domi—
is more applicable to a career of art and literature than to a political and
social ambition.
Wife and children I have not reckoned amongst a man's possessions: he is
rather in their possession. It would be easier to include friends under that
head; but a man's friends belong to him not a whit more than he belongs to
them.
## CHAPTER IV.
POSITION, OR A MAN'S PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF OTHERS.
Section 1.—Reputation.
By a peculiar weakness of human nature, people generally think too much
about the opinion which others form of them; although the slightest
reflection will show that this opinion, whatever it may be, is not in itself
essential to happiness. Therefore it is hard to understand why everybody
feels so very pleased when he sees that other people have a good opinion
of him, or say anything flattering to his vanity. If you stroke a cat, it will
purr; and, as inevitably, if you praise a man, a sweet expression of delight
will appear on his face; and even though the praise is a palpable lie, it will
be welcome, if the matter is one on which he prides himself. If only other
people will applaud him, a man may console himself for downright
misfortune or for the pittance he gets from the two sources of human
happiness already discussed: and conversely, it is astonishing how
infallibly a man will be annoyed, and in some cases deeply pained, by any
wrong done to his feeling of self-importance, whatever be the nature,
degree, or circumstances of the injury, or by any depreciation, slight, or
disregard.
If the feeling of honor rests upon this peculiarity of human nature, it may
have a very salutary effect upon the welfare of a great many people, as a
substitute for morality; but upon their happiness, more especially upon
that peace of mind and independence which are so essential to happiness,
its effect will be disturbing and prejudicial rather than salutary. Therefore it
is advisable, from our point of view, to set limits to this weakness, and duly
to consider and rightly to estimate the relative value of advantages, and
thus temper, as far as possible, this great susceptibility to other people's
opinion, whether the opinion be one flattering to our vanity, or whether it
causes us pain; for in either case it is the same feeling which is touched.
Otherwise, a man is the slave of what other people are pleased to think,—
and how little it requires to disconcert or soothe the mind that is greedy of
praise:
Sic leve, sic parvum est, animum quod laudis avarum Subruit ac reficit.
Therefore it will very much conduce to our happiness if we duly compare
the value of what a man is in and for himself with what he is in the eyes of
others. Under the former conies everything that fills up the span of our
existence and makes it what it is, in short, all the advantages already
considered and summed up under the heads of personality and property;
and the sphere in which all this takes place is the man's own consciousness.
On the other hand, the sphere of what we are for other people is their
consciousness, not ours; it is the kind of figure we make in their eyes,
together with the thoughts which this arouses. But this is something which
has no direct and immediate existence for us, but can affect us only
mediately and indirectly, so far, that is, as other people's behavior towards
us is directed by it; and even then it ought to affect us only in so far as it
can move us to modify what we are in and for ourselves. Apart from this,
what goes on in other people's consciousness is, as such, a matter of
indifference to us; and in time we get really indifferent to it, when we come
to see how superficial and futile are most people's thoughts, how narrow
their ideas, how mean their sentiments, how perverse their opinions, and
how much of error there is in most of them; when we learn by experience
with what depreciation a man will speak of his fellow, when he is not
obliged to fear him, or thinks that what he says will not come to his ears.
And if ever we have had an opportunity of seeing how the greatest of men
will meet with nothing but slight from half-a-dozen blockheads, we shall
understand that to lay great value upon what other people say is to pay
them too much honor.
At all events, a man is in a very bad way, who finds no source of happiness
in the first two classes of blessings already treated of, but has to seek it in
the third, in other words, not in what he is in himself, but in what he is in
the opinion of others. For, after all, the foundation of our whole nature,
and, therefore, of our happiness, is our physique, and the most essential
factor in happiness is health, and, next in importance after health, the
ability to maintain ourselves in independence and freedom from care.
There can be no competition or compensation between these essential
factors on the one side, and honor, pomp, rank and reputation on the other,
however much value we may set upon the latter. No one would hesitate to
sacrifice the latter for the former, if it were necessary. We should add very
much to our happiness by a timely recognition of the simple truth that
every man's chief and real existence is in his own skin, and not in other
people's opinions; and, consequently, that the actual conditions of our
personal life,—health, temperament, capacity, income, wife, children,
friends, home, are a hundred times more important for our happiness than
what other people are pleased to think of us: otherwise we shall be
miserable. And if people insist that honor is dearer than life itself, what
they really mean is that existence and well-being are as nothing compared
with other people's opinions. Of course, this may be only an exaggerated
way of stating the prosaic truth that reputation, that is, the opinion others
have of us, is indispensable if we are to make any progress in the world;
but I shall come back to that presently. When we see that almost everything
men devote their lives to attain, sparing no effort and encountering a
thousand toils and dangers in the process, has, in the end, no further object
than to raise themselves in the estimation of others; when we see that not
only offices, titles, decorations, but also wealth, nay, even knowledge and
art, are striven for only to obtain, as the ultimate goal of all effort, greater
respect from one's fellowmen,—is not this a lamentable proof of the extent
to which human folly can go? To set much too high a value on other
people's opinion is a common error everywhere; an error, it may be, rooted
in human nature itself, or the result of civilization, and social arrangements
generally; but, whatever its source, it exercises a very immoderate
influence on all we do, and is very prejudicial to our happiness. We can
trace it from a timorous and slavish regard for what other people will say,
up to the feeling which made Virginius plunge the dagger into his
daughter's heart, or induces many a man to sacrifice quiet, riches, health
and even life itself, for posthumous glory. Undoubtedly this feeling is a
very convenient instrument in the hands of those who have the control or
direction of their fellowmen; and accordingly we find that in every scheme
for training up humanity in the way it should go, the maintenance and
strengthening of the feeling of honor occupies an important place. But it is
quite a different matter in its effect on human happiness, of which it is here
our object to treat; and we should rather be careful to dissuade people from
setting too much store by what others think of them. Daily experience
shows us, however, that this is just the mistake people persist in making;
most men set the utmost value precisely on what other people think, and
are more concerned about it than about what goes on in their own
consciousness, which is the thing most immediately and directly present to
them. They reverse the natural order,—regarding the opinions of others as
real existence and their own consciousness as something shadowy; making
the derivative and secondary into the principal, and considering the picture
they present to the world of more importance than their own selves. By
thus trying to get a direct and immediate result out of what has no really
direct or immediate existence, they fall into the kind of folly which is called
vanity—the appropriate term for that which has no solid or instrinsic
value. Like a miser, such people forget the end in their eagerness to obtain
the means.
The truth is that the value we set upon the opinion of others, and our
constant endeavor in respect of it, are each quite out of proportion to any
result we may reasonably hope to attain; so that this attention to other
people's attitude may be regarded as a kind of universal mania which
every one inherits. In all we do, almost the first thing we think about is,
what will people say; and nearly half the troubles and bothers of life may
be traced to our anxiety on this score; it is the anxiety which is at the
bottom of all that feeling of self-importance, which is so often mortified
because it is so very morbidly sensitive. It is solicitude about what others
will say that underlies all our vanity and pretension, yes, and all our show
and swagger too. Without it, there would not be a tenth part of the luxury
which exists. Pride in every form, point d'honneur and punctilio, however
varied their kind or sphere, are at bottom nothing but this—anxiety about
what others will say—and what sacrifices it costs! One can see it even in a
child; and though it exists at every period of life, it is strongest in age;
because, when the capacity for sensual pleasure fails, vanity and pride
have only avarice to share their dominion. Frenchmen, perhaps, afford the
best example of this feeling, and amongst them it is a regular epidemic,
appearing sometimes in the most absurd ambition, or in a ridiculous kind
of national vanity and the most shameless boasting. However, they
frustrate their own gains, for other people make fun of them and call them
la grande nation.
By way of specially illustrating this perverse and exuberant respect for
other people's opinion, let me take passage from the Times of March 31st,
1846, giving a detailed account of the execution of one Thomas Wix, an
apprentice who, from motives of vengeance, had murdered his master.
Here we have very unusual circumstances and an extraordinary character,
though one very suitable for our purpose; and these combine to give a
striking picture of this folly, which is so deeply rooted in human nature,
and allow us to form an accurate notion of the extent to which it will go.
On the morning of the execution, says the report, the rev. ordinary was
early in attendance upon him, but Wix, beyond a quiet demeanor, betrayed
no interest in his ministrations, appearing to feel anxious only to acquit
himself "bravely" before the spectators of his ignomininous end…. In the
procession Wix fell into his proper place with alacrity, and, as he entered
the Chapel-yard, remarked, sufficiently loud to be heard by several persons
near him, "Now, then, as Dr. Dodd said, I shall soon know the grand
secret." On reaching the scaffold, the miserable wretch mounted the drop
without the slightest assistance, and when he got to the centre, he bowed to
the spectators twice, a proceeding which called forth a tremendous cheer
from the degraded crowd beneath.
This is an admirable example of the way in which a man, with death in the
most dreadful form before his very eyes, and eternity beyond it, will care
for nothing but the impression he makes upon a crowd of gapers, and the
opinion he leaves behind him in their heads. There was much the same
kind of thing in the case of Lecompte, who was executed at Frankfurt, also
in 1846, for an attempt on the king's life. At the trial he was very much
annoyed that he was not allowed to appear, in decent attire, before the
Upper House; and on the day of the execution it was a special grief to him
that he was not permitted to shave. It is not only in recent times that this
kind of thing has been known to happen. Mateo Aleman tells us, in the
Introduction to his celebrated romance, Juzman de Alfarache, that many
infatuated criminals, instead of devoting their last hours to the welfare of
their souls, as they ought to have done, neglect this duty for the purpose of
preparing and committing to memory a speech to be made from the
scaffold.
I take these extreme cases as being the best illustrations to what I mean; for
they give us a magnified reflection of our own nature. The anxieties of all
of us, our worries, vexations, bothers, troubles, uneasy apprehensions and
strenuous efforts are due, in perhaps the large majority of instances, to
what other people will say; and we are just as foolish in this respect as
those miserable criminals. Envy and hatred are very often traceable to a
similar source.
Now, it is obvious that happiness, which consists for the most part in peace
of mind and contentment, would be served by nothing so much as by
reducing this impulse of human nature within reasonable limits,—which
would perhaps make it one fiftieth part of what it is now. By doing so, we
should get rid of a thorn in the flesh which is always causing us pain. But it
is a very difficult task, because the impulse in question is a natural and
innate perversity of human nature. Tacitus says, The lust of fame is the last
that a wise man shakes off The only way of putting an end to this universal
folly is to see clearly that it is a folly; and this may be done by recognizing
the fact that most of the opinions in men's heads are apt to be false,
perverse, erroneous and absurd, and so in themselves unworthy of
attention; further, that other people's opinions can have very little real and
positive influence upon us in most of the circumstances and affairs of life.
Again, this opinion is generally of such an unfavorable character that it
would worry a man to death to hear everything that was said of him, or the
tone in which he was spoken of. And finally, among other things, we
should be clear about the fact that honor itself has no really direct, but only
an indirect, value. If people were generally converted from this universal
folly, the result would be such an addition to our piece of mind and
cheerfulness as at present seems inconceivable; people would present a
firmer and more confident front to the world, and generally behave with
less embarrassment and restraint. It is observable that a retired mode of life
has an exceedingly beneficial influence on our peace of mind, and this is
mainly because we thus escape having to live constantly in the sight of
others, and pay everlasting regard to their casual opinions; in a word, we
are able to return upon ourselves. At the same time a good deal of positive
misfortune might be avoided, which we are now drawn into by striving
after shadows, or, to speak more correctly, by indulging a mischievous
piece of folly; and we should consequently have more attention to give to
solid realities and enjoy them with less interruption that at present. But
[Greek: chalepa ga kala]—what is worth doing is hard to do.
Section 2.—Pride.
The folly of our nature which we are discussing puts forth three shoots,
ambition, vanity and pride. The difference between the last two is this:
pride is an established conviction of one's own paramount worth in some
particular respect; while vanity is the desire of rousing such a conviction in
others, and it is generally accompanied by the secret hope of ultimately
coming to the same conviction oneself. Pride works from within; it is the
direct appreciation of oneself. Vanity is the desire to arrive at this
appreciation indirectly, from without. So we find that vain people are
talkative, proud, and taciturn. But the vain person ought to be aware that
the good opinion of others, which he strives for, may be obtained much
more easily and certainly by persistent silence than by speech, even though
he has very good things to say. Anyone who wishes to affect pride is not
therefore a proud man; but he will soon have to drop this, as every other,
assumed character.
It is only a firm, unshakeable conviction of pre-eminent worth and special
value which makes a man proud in the true sense of the word,—a
conviction which may, no doubt, be a mistaken one or rest on advantages
which are of an adventitious and conventional character: still pride is not
the less pride for all that, so long as it be present in real earnest. And since
pride is thus rooted in conviction, it resembles every other form of
knowledge in not being within our own arbitrament. Pride's worst foe,—I
mean its greatest obstacle,—is vanity, which courts the applause of the
world in order to gain the necessary foundation for a high opinion of one's
own worth, whilst pride is based upon a pre-existing conviction of it.
It is quite true that pride is something which is generally found fault with,
and cried down; but usually, I imagine, by those who have nothing upon
which they can pride themselves. In view of the impudence and
foolhardiness of most people, anyone who possesses any kind of
superiority or merit will do well to keep his eyes fixed on it, if he does not
want it to be entirely forgotten; for if a man is good-natured enough to
ignore his own privileges, and hob-nob with the generality of other people,
as if he were quite on their level, they will be sure to treat him, frankly and
candidly, as one of themselves. This is a piece of advice I would specially
offer to those whose superiority is of the highest kind—real superiority, I
mean, of a purely personal nature—which cannot, like orders and titles,
appeal to the eye or ear at every moment; as, otherwise, they will find that
familiarity breeds contempt, or, as the Romans used to say, sus Minervam.
Joke with a slave, and he'll soon show his heels, is an excellent Arabian
proverb; nor ought we to despise what Horace says,
Sume superbiam Quaesitam meritis.
—usurp the fame you have deserved. No doubt, when modesty was made
a virtue, it was a very advantageous thing for the fools; for everybody is
expected to speak of himself as if he were one. This is leveling down
indeed; for it comes to look as if there were nothing but fools in the world.
The cheapest sort of pride is national pride; for if a man is proud of his own
nation, it argues that he has no qualities of his own of which he can be
proud; otherwise he would not have recourse to those which he shares
with so many millions of his fellowmen. The man who is endowed with
important personal qualities will be only too ready to see clearly in what
respects his own nation falls short, since their failings will be constantly
before his eyes. But every miserable fool who has nothing at all of which he
can be proud adopts, as a last resource, pride in the nation to which he
belongs; he is ready and glad to defend all its faults and follies tooth and
nail, thus reimbursing himself for his own inferiority. For example, if you
speak of the stupid and degrading bigotry of the English nation with the
contempt it deserves, you will hardly find one Englishman in fifty to agree
with you; but if there should be one, he will generally happen to be an
intelligent man.
The Germans have no national pride, which shows how honest they are, as
everybody knows! and how dishonest are those who, by a piece of
ridiculous affectation, pretend that they are proud of their country—the
Deutsche Bruder and the demagogues who flatter the mob in order to
mislead it. I have heard it said that gunpowder was invented by a German.
I doubt it. Lichtenberg asks, Why is it that a man who is not a German does
not care about pretending that he is one; and that if he makes any pretence
at all, it is to be a Frenchman or an Englishman?
However that may be, individuality is a far more important thing than
nationality, and in any given man deserves a thousand-fold more
consideration. And since you cannot speak of national character without
referring to large masses of people, it is impossible to be loud in your
praises and at the same time honest. National character is only another
name for the particular form which the littleness, perversity and baseness
of mankind take in every country. If we become disgusted with one, we
praise another, until we get disgusted with this too. Every nation mocks at
other nations, and all are right.
The contents of this chapter, which treats, as I have said, of what we
represent in the world, or what we are in the eyes of others, may be further
distributed under three heads: honor rank and fame.

Section 3.—Rank.
Let us take rank first, as it may be dismissed in a few words, although it
plays an important part in the eyes of the masses and of the philistines, and
is a most useful wheel in the machinery of the State.
It has a purely conventional value. Strictly speaking, it is a sham; its
method is to exact an artificial respect, and, as a matter of fact, the whole
thing is a mere farce.

Orders, it may be said, are bills of exchange drawn on public opinion, and
the measure of their value is the credit of the drawer. Of course, as a
substitute for pensions, they save the State a good deal of money; and,
besides, they serve a very useful purpose, if they are distributed with
discrimination and judgment. For people in general have eyes and ears, it
is true; but not much else, very little judgment indeed, or even memory.
There are many services of the State quite beyond the range of their
understanding; others, again, are appreciated and made much of for a time,
and then soon forgotten. It seems to me, therefore, very proper, that a cross
or a star should proclaim to the mass of people always and everywhere,
This man is not like you; he has done something. But orders lose their
value when they are distributed unjustly, or without due selection, or in
too great numbers: a prince should be as careful in conferring them as a
man of business is in signing a bill. It is a pleonasm to inscribe on any order
for distinguished service; for every order ought to be for distinguished
service. That stands to reason.

Section 4.—Honor.
Honor is a much larger question than rank, and more difficult to discuss.
Let us begin by trying to define it.
If I were to say Honor is external conscience, and conscience is inward
honor, no doubt a good many people would assent; but there would be
more show than reality about such a definition, and it would hardly go to
the root of the matter. I prefer to say, Honor is, on its objective side, other
people's opinion of what we are worth; on its subjective side, it is the
respect we pay to this opinion. From the latter point of view, to be a man of
honor is to exercise what is often a very wholesome, but by no means a
purely moral, influence.

The feelings of honor and shame exist in every man who is not utterly
depraved, and honor is everywhere recognized as something particularly
valuable. The reason of this is as follows. By and in himself a man can
accomplish very little; he is like Robinson Crusoe on a desert island. It is
only in society that a man's powers can be called into full activity. He very
soon finds this out when his consciousness begins to develop, and there
arises in him the desire to be looked upon as a useful member of society, as
one, that is, who is capable of playing his part as a man—pro parte virili—
thereby acquiring a right to the benefits of social life. Now, to be a useful
member of society, one must do two things: firstly, what everyone is
expected to do everywhere; and, secondly, what one's own particular
position in the world demands and requires.

But a man soon discovers that everything depends upon his being useful,
not in his own opinion, but in the opinion of others; and so he tries his best
to make that favorable impression upon the world, to which he attaches
such a high value. Hence, this primitive and innate characteristic of human
nature, which is called the feeling of honor, or, under another aspect, the
feeling of shame—verecundia. It is this which brings a blush to his cheeks
at the thought of having suddenly to fall in the estimation of others, even
when he knows that he is innocent, nay, even if his remissness extends to
no absolute obligation, but only to one which he has taken upon himself of
his own free will. Conversely, nothing in life gives a man so much courage
as the attainment or renewal of the conviction that other people regard him
with favor; because it means that everyone joins to give him help and
protection, which is an infinitely stronger bulwark against the ills of life
than anything he can do himself.

The variety of relations in which a man can stand to other people so as to
obtain their confidence, that is, their good opinion, gives rise to a
distinction between several kinds of honor, resting chiefly on the different
bearings that meum may take to tuum; or, again, on the performance of
various pledges; or finally, on the relation of the sexes. Hence, there are
three main kinds of honor, each of which takes various forms—civic honor,
official honor, and sexual honor.

Civic honor has the widest sphere of all. It consists in the assumption that
we shall pay unconditional respect to the rights of others, and, therefore,
never use any unjust or unlawful means of getting what we want. It is the
condition of all peaceable intercourse between man and man; and it is
destroyed by anything that openly and manifestly militates against this
peaceable intercourse, anything, accordingly, which entails punishment at
the hands of the law, always supposing that the punishment is a just one.
The ultimate foundation of honor is the conviction that moral character is
unalterable: a single bad action implies that future actions of the same kind
will, under similar circumstances, also be bad. This is well expressed by the
English use of the word character as meaning credit, reputation, honor.
Hence honor, once lost, can never be recovered; unless the loss rested on
some mistake, such as may occur if a man is slandered or his actions
viewed in a false light. So the law provides remedies against slander, libel,
and even insult; for insult though it amounts to no more than mere abuse,
is a kind of summary slander with a suppression of the reasons. What I
mean may be well put in the Greek phrase—not quoted from any author—
[Greek: estin hae loidoria diabolae]. It is true that if a man abuses another,
he is simply showing that he has no real or true causes of complaint against
him; as, otherwise, he would bring these forward as the premises, and rely
upon his hearers to draw the conclusion themselves: instead of which, he
gives the conclusion and leaves out the premises, trusting that people will
suppose that he has done so only for the sake of being brief.

Civic honor draws its existence and name from the middle classes; but it
applies equally to all, not excepting the highest. No man can disregard it,
and it is a very serious thing, of which every one should be careful not to
make light. The man who breaks confidence has for ever forfeited
confidence, whatever he may do, and whoever he may be; and the bitter
consequences of the loss of confidence can never be averted.

There is a sense in which honor may be said to have a negative character in
opposition to the positive character of fame. For honor is not the opinion
people have of particular qualities which a man may happen to possess
exclusively: it is rather the opinion they have of the qualities which a man
may be expected to exhibit, and to which he should not prove false. Honor,
therefore, means that a man is not exceptional; fame, that he is. Fame is
something which must be won; honor, only something which must not be
lost. The absence of fame is obscurity, which is only a negative; but loss of
honor is shame, which is a positive quality. This negative character of
honor must not be confused with anything passive; for honor is above all
things active in its working. It is the only quality which proceeds directly
from the man who exhibits it; it is concerned entirely with what he does
and leaves undone, and has nothing to do with the actions of others or the
obstacles they place in his way. It is something entirely in our own
power—[Greek: ton ephaemon]. This distinction, as we shall see presently,
marks off true honor from the sham honor of chivalry.

Slander is the only weapon by which honor can be attacked from without;
and the only way to repel the attack is to confute the slander with the
proper amount of publicity, and a due unmasking of him who utters it.
The reason why respect is paid to age is that old people have necessarily
shown in the course of their lives whether or not they have been able to
maintain their honor unblemished; while that of young people has not
been put to the proof, though they are credited with the possession of it.
For neither length of years,—equalled, as it is, and even excelled, in the
case of the lower animals,—nor, again, experience, which is only a closer
knowledge of the world's ways, can be any sufficient reason for the respect
which the young are everywhere required to show towards the old: for if it
were merely a matter of years, the weakness which attends on age would
call rather for consideration than for respect. It is, however, a remarkable
fact that white hair always commands reverence—a reverence really innate
and instinctive. Wrinkles—a much surer sign of old age—command no
reverence at all; you never hear any one speak of venerable wrinkles; but
venerable white hair is a common expression.

Honor has only an indirect value. For, as I explained at the beginning of
this chapter, what other people think of us, if it affects us at all, can affect
us only in so far as it governs their behavior towards us, and only just so
long as we live with, or have to do with, them. But it is to society alone that
we owe that safety which we and our possessions enjoy in a state of
civilization; in all we do we need the help of others, and they, in their turn,
must have confidence in us before they can have anything to do with us.
Accordingly, their opinion of us is, indirectly, a matter of great importance;
though I cannot see how it can have a direct or immediate value. This is an
opinion also held by Cicero. I quite agree, he writes, with what Chrysippus
and Diogenes used to say, that a good reputation is not worth raising a
finger to obtain, if it were not that it is so useful. This truth has been
insisted upon at great length by Helvetius in his chief work De l'Esprit, the
conclusion of which is that we love esteem not for its own sake, but solely
for the advantages which it brings. And as the means can never be more
than the end, that saying, of which so much is made, Honor is dearer than
life itself, is, as I have remarked, a very exaggerated statement. So much
then, for civic honor.
Official honor is the general opinion of other people that a man who fills
any office really has the necessary qualities for the proper discharge of all
the duties which appertain to it. The greater and more important the duties
a man has to discharge in the State, and the higher and more influential the
office which he fills, the stronger must be the opinion which people have of
the moral and intellectual qualities which render him fit for his post.
Therefore, the higher his position, the greater must be the degree of honor
paid to him, expressed, as it is, in titles, orders and the generally
subservient behavior of others towards him. As a rule, a man's official rank
implies the particular degree of honor which ought to be paid to him,
however much this degree may be modified by the capacity of the masses
to form any notion of its importance. Still, as a matter of fact, greater honor
is paid to a man who fulfills special duties than to the common citizen,
whose honor mainly consists in keeping clear of dishonor.

Official honor demands, further, that the man who occupies an office must
maintain respect for it, for the sake both of his colleagues and of those who
will come after him. This respect an official can maintain by a proper
observance of his duties, and by repelling any attack that may be made
upon the office itself or upon its occupant: he must not, for instance, pass
over unheeded any statement to the effect that the duties of the office are
not properly discharged, or that the office itself does not conduce to the
public welfare. He must prove the unwarrantable nature of such attacks by
enforcing the legal penalty for them.

Subordinate to the honor of official personages comes that of those who
serve the State in any other capacity, as doctors, lawyers, teachers, anyone,
in short, who, by graduating in any subject, or by any other public
declaration that he is qualified to exercise some special skill, claims to
practice it; in a word, the honor of all those who take any public pledges
whatever. Under this head comes military honor, in the true sense of the
word, the opinion that people who have bound themselves to defend their
country really possess the requisite qualities which will enable them to do
so, especially courage, personal bravery and strength, and that they are
perfectly ready to defend their country to the death, and never and under
any circumstances desert the flag to which they have once sworn
allegiance. I have here taken official honor in a wider sense than that in
which it is generally used, namely, the respect due by citizens to an office
itself.

In treating of sexual honor and the principles on which it rests, a little more
attention and analysis are necessary; and what I shall say will support my
contention that all honor really rests upon a utilitarian basis. There are two
natural divisions of the subject—the honor of women and the honor of
men, in either side issuing in a well-understood esprit de corps. The former
is by far the more important of the two, because the most essential feature
in woman's life is her relation to man.

Female honor is the general opinion in regard to a girl that she is pure, and
in regard to a wife that she is faithful. The importance of this opinion rests
upon the following considerations. Women depend upon men in all the
relations of life; men upon women, it might be said, in one only. So an
arrangement is made for mutual interdependence—man undertaking
responsibility for all woman's needs and also for the children that spring
from their union—an arrangement on which is based the welfare of the
whole female race. To carry out this plan, women have to band together
with a show of esprit de corps, and present one undivided front to their
common enemy, man,—who possesses all the good things of the earth, in
virtue of his superior physical and intellectual power,—in order to lay
siege to and conquer him, and so get possession of him and a share of those
good things. To this end the honor of all women depends upon the
enforcement of the rule that no woman should give herself to a man except
in marriage, in order that every man may be forced, as it were, to surrender
and ally himself with a woman; by this arrangement provision is made for
the whole of the female race. This is a result, however, which can be
obtained only by a strict observance of the rule; and, accordingly, women
everywhere show true esprit de corps in carefully insisting upon its
maintenance. Any girl who commits a breach of the rule betrays the whole
female race, because its welfare would be destroyed if every woman were
to do likewise; so she is cast out with shame as one who has lost her honor.
No woman will have anything more to do with her; she is avoided like the
plague. The same doom is awarded to a woman who breaks the marriage
tie; for in so doing she is false to the terms upon which the man
capitulated; and as her conduct is such as to frighten other men from
making a similar surrender, it imperils the welfare of all her sisters. Nay,
more; this deception and coarse breach of troth is a crime punishable by the
loss, not only of personal, but also of civic honor. This is why we minimize
the shame of a girl, but not of a wife; because, in the former case, marriage
can restore honor, while in the latter, no atonement can be made for the
breach of contract.
Once this esprit de corps is acknowledged to be the foundation of female
honor, and is seen to be a wholesome, nay, a necessary arrangement, as at
bottom a matter of prudence and interest, its extreme importance for the
welfare of women will be recognized. But it does not possess anything
more than a relative value. It is no absolute end, lying beyond all other
aims of existence and valued above life itself. In this view, there will be
nothing to applaud in the forced and extravagant conduct of a Lucretia or a
Virginius—conduct which can easily degenerate into tragic farce, and
produce a terrible feeling of revulsion. The conclusion of Emilia Galotti, for
instance, makes one leave the theatre completely ill at ease; and, on the
other hand, all the rules of female honor cannot prevent a certain sympathy
with Clara in Egmont. To carry this principle of female honor too far is to
forget the end in thinking of the means—and this is just what people often
do; for such exaggeration suggests that the value of sexual honor is
absolute; while the truth is that it is more relative than any other kind. One
might go so far as to say that its value is purely conventional, when one
sees from Thomasius how in all ages and countries, up to the time of the
Reformation, irregularities were permitted and recognized by law, with no
derogation to female honor,—not to speak of the temple of Mylitta at
Babylon.
There are also of course certain circumstances in civil life which make
external forms of marriage impossible, especially in Catholic countries,
where there is no such thing as divorce. Ruling princes everywhere, would,
in my opinion, do much better, from a moral point of view, to dispense
with forms altogether rather than contract a morganatic marriage, the
descendants of which might raise claims to the throne if the legitimate
stock happened to die out; so that there is a possibility, though, perhaps, a
remote one, that a morganatic marriage might produce a civil war. And,
besides, such a marriage, concluded in defiance of all outward ceremony, is
a concession made to women and priests—two classes of persons to whom
one should be most careful to give as little tether as possible. It is further to
be remarked that every man in a country can marry the woman of his
choice, except one poor individual, namely, the prince. His hand belongs to
his country, and can be given in marriage only for reasons of State, that is,
for the good of the country. Still, for all that, he is a man; and, as a man, he
likes to follow whither his heart leads. It is an unjust, ungrateful and
priggish thing to forbid, or to desire to forbid, a prince from following his
inclinations in this matter; of course, as long as the lady has no influence
upon the Government of the country. From her point of view she occupies
an exceptional position, and does not come under the ordinary rules of
sexual honor; for she has merely given herself to a man who loves her, and
whom she loves but cannot marry. And in general, the fact that the
principle of female honor has no origin in nature, is shown by the many
bloody sacrifices which have been offered to it,—the murder of children
and the mother's suicide. No doubt a girl who contravenes the code
commits a breach of faith against her whole sex; but this faith is one which
is only secretly taken for granted, and not sworn to. And since, in most
cases, her own prospects suffer most immediately, her folly is infinitely
greater than her crime.
The corresponding virtue in men is a product of the one I have been
discussing. It is their esprit de corps, which demands that, once a man has
made that surrender of himself in marriage which is so advantageous to his
conqueror, he shall take care that the terms of the treaty are maintained;
both in order that the agreement itself may lose none of its force by the
permission of any laxity in its observance, and that men, having given up
everything, may, at least, be assured of their bargain, namely, exclusive
possession. Accordingly, it is part of a man's honor to resent a breach of the
marriage tie on the part of his wife, and to punish it, at the very least by
separating from her. If he condones the offence, his fellowmen cry shame
upon him; but the shame in this case is not nearly so foul as that of the
woman who has lost her honor; the stain is by no means of so deep a dye—
levioris notae macula;—because a man's relation to woman is subordinate
to many other and more important affairs in his life. The two great
dramatic poets of modern times have each taken man's honor as the theme
of two plays; Shakespeare in Othello and The Winter's Tale, and Calderon
in El medico de su honra, (The Physician of his Honor), and A secreto
agravio secreta venganza, (for Secret Insult Secret Vengeance). It should be
said, however, that honor demands the punishment of the wife only; to
punish her paramour too, is a work of supererogation. This confirms the
view I have taken, that a man's honor originates in esprit de corps.
The kind of honor which I have been discussing hitherto has always
existed in its various forms and principles amongst all nations and at all
times; although the history of female honor shows that its principles have
undergone certain local modifications at different periods. But there is
another species of honor which differs from this entirely, a species of honor
of which the Greeks and Romans had no conception, and up to this day it
is perfectly unknown amongst Chinese, Hindoos or Mohammedans. It is a
kind of honor which arose only in the Middle Age, and is indigenous only
to Christian Europe, nay, only to an extremely small portion of the
population, that is to say, the higher classes of society and those who ape
them. It is knightly honor, or point d'honneur. Its principles are quite
different from those which underlie the kind of honor I have been treating
until now, and in some respects are even opposed to them. The sort I am
referring to produces the cavalier; while the other kind creates the man of
honor. As this is so, I shall proceed to give an explanation of its principles,
as a kind of code or mirror of knightly courtesy.
(1.) To begin with, honor of this sort consists, not in other people's opinion
of what we are worth, but wholly and entirely in whether they express it or
not, no matter whether they really have any opinion at all, let alone
whether they know of reasons for having one. Other people may entertain
the worst opinion of us in consequence of what we do, and may despise us
as much as they like; so long as no one dares to give expression to his
opinion, our honor remains untarnished. So if our actions and qualities
compel the highest respect from other people, and they have no option but
to give this respect,—as soon as anyone, no matter how wicked or foolish
he may be, utters something depreciatory of us, our honor is offended, nay,
gone for ever, unless we can manage to restore it. A superfluous proof of
what I say, namely, that knightly honor depends, not upon what people
think, but upon what they say, is furnished by the fact that insults can be
withdrawn, or, if necessary, form the subject of an apology, which makes
them as though they had never been uttered. Whether the opinion which
underlays the expression has also been rectified, and why the expression
should ever have been used, are questions which are perfectly
unimportant: so long as the statement is withdrawn, all is well. The truth is
that conduct of this kind aims, not at earning respect, but at extorting it.
(2.) In the second place, this sort of honor rests, not on what a man does,
but on what he suffers, the obstacles he encounters; differing from the
honor which prevails in all else, in consisting, not in what he says or does
himself, but in what another man says or does. His honor is thus at the
mercy of every man who can talk it away on the tip of his tongue; and if he
attacks it, in a moment it is gone for ever,—unless the man who is attacked
manages to wrest it back again by a process which I shall mention
presently, a process which involves danger to his life, health, freedom,
property and peace of mind. A man's whole conduct may be in accordance
with the most righteous and noble principles, his spirit may be the purest
that ever breathed, his intellect of the very highest order; and yet his honor
may disappear the moment that anyone is pleased to insult him, anyone at
all who has not offended against this code of honor himself, let him be the
most worthless rascal or the most stupid beast, an idler, gambler, debtor, a
man, in short, of no account at all. It is usually this sort of fellow who likes
to insult people; for, as Seneca rightly remarks, ut quisque contemtissimus
et ludibrio est, ita solutissimae est, the more contemptible and ridiculous a
man is,—the readier he is with his tongue. His insults are most likely to be
directed against the very kind of man I have described, because people of
different tastes can never be friends, and the sight of pre-eminent merit is
apt to raise the secret ire of a ne'er-do-well. What Goethe says in the
Westöstlicher Divan is quite true, that it is useless to complain against your
enemies; for they can never become your friends, if your whole being is a
standing reproach to them:—
Was klagst du über Feinde?
Sollten Solche je warden Freunde
Denen das Wesen, wie du bist,
Im stillen ein ewiger Vorwurf ist?
It is obvious that people of this worthless description have good cause to be
thankful to the principle of honor, because it puts them on a level with
people who in every other respect stand far above them. If a fellow likes to
insult any one, attribute to him, for example, some bad quality, this is taken
prima facie as a well-founded opinion, true in fact; a decree, as it were,
with all the force of law; nay, if it is not at once wiped out in blood, it is a
judgment which holds good and valid to all time. In other words, the man
who is insulted remains—in the eyes of all honorable people—what the
man who uttered the insult—even though he were the greatest wretch on
earth—was pleased to call him; for he has put up with the insult—the
technical term, I believe. Accordingly, all honorable people will have
nothing more to do with him, and treat him like a leper, and, it may be,
refuse to go into any company where he may be found, and so on.
This wise proceeding may, I think, be traced back to the fact that in the
Middle Age, up to the fifteenth century, it was not the accuser in any
criminal process who had to prove the guilt of the accused, but the accused
who had to prove his innocence. This he could do by swearing he was not
guilty; and his backers—consacramentales—had to come and swear that in
their opinion he was incapable of perjury. If he could find no one to help
him in this way, or the accuser took objection to his backers, recourse was
had to trial by the Judgment of God, which generally meant a duel. For the
accused was now in disgrace, and had to clear himself. Here, then, is the
origin of the notion of disgrace, and of that whole system which prevails
now-a-days amongst honorable people—only that the oath is omitted. This
is also the explanation of that deep feeling of indignation which honorable
people are called upon to show if they are given the lie; it is a reproach
which they say must be wiped out in blood. It seldom comes to this pass,
however, though lies are of common occurrence; but in England, more than
elsewhere, it is a superstition which has taken very deep root. As a matter
of order, a man who threatens to kill another for telling a lie should never
have told one himself. The fact is, that the criminal trial of the Middle Age
also admitted of a shorter form. In reply to the charge, the accused
answered: That is a lie; whereupon it was left to be decided by the
Judgment of God. Hence, the code of knightly honor prescribes that, when
the lie is given, an appeal to arms follows as a matter of course. So much,
then, for the theory of insult.
But there is something even worse than insult, something so dreadful that I
must beg pardon of all honorable people for so much as mentioning it in
this code of knightly honor; for I know they will shiver, and their hair will
stand on end, at the very thought of it—the summum malum, the greatest
evil on earth, worse than death and damnation. A man may give another—
horrible dictu!—a slap or a blow. This is such an awful thing, and so utterly
fatal to all honor, that, while any other species of insult may be healed by
blood-letting, this can be cured only by the coup-de-grace.
(3.) In the third place, this kind of honor has absolutely nothing to do with
what a man may be in and for himself; or, again, with the question whether
his moral character can ever become better or worse, and all such pedantic
inquiries. If your honor happens to be attacked, or to all appearances gone,
it can very soon be restored in its entirety if you are only quick enough in
having recourse to the one universal remedy—a duel. But if the aggressor
does not belong to the classes which recognize the code of knightly honor,
or has himself once offended against it, there is a safer way of meeting any
attack upon your honor, whether it consists in blows, or merely in words. If
you are armed, you can strike down your opponent on the spot, or perhaps
an hour later. This will restore your honor.
But if you wish to avoid such an extreme step, from fear of any unpleasant
consequences arising therefrom, or from uncertainty as to whether the
aggressor is subject to the laws of knightly honor or not, there is another
means of making your position good, namely, the Avantage. This consists
in returning rudeness with still greater rudeness; and if insults are no use,
you can try a blow, which forms a sort of climax in the redemption of your
honor; for instance, a box on the ear may be cured by a blow with a stick,
and a blow with a stick by a thrashing with a horsewhip; and, as the
approved remedy for this last, some people recommend you to spit at your
opponent. If all these means are of no avail, you must not shrink from
drawing blood. And the reason for these methods of wiping out insult is, in
this code, as follows:
(4.) To receive an insult is disgraceful; to give one, honorable. Let me take
an example. My opponent has truth, right and reason on his side. Very
well. I insult him. Thereupon right and honor leave him and come to me,
and, for the time being, he has lost them—until he gets them back, not by
the exercise of right or reason, but by shooting and sticking me.
Accordingly, rudeness is a quality which, in point of honor, is a substitute
for any other and outweighs them all. The rudest is always right. What
more do you want? However stupid, bad or wicked a man may have been,
if he is only rude into the bargain, he condones and legitimizes all his
faults. If in any discussion or conversation, another man shows more
knowledge, greater love of truth, a sounder judgment, better
understanding than we, or generally exhibits intellectual qualities which
cast ours into the shade, we can at once annul his superiority and our own
shallowness, and in our turn be superior to him, by being insulting and
offensive. For rudeness is better than any argument; it totally eclipses
intellect. If our opponent does not care for our mode of attack, and will not
answer still more rudely, so as to plunge us into the ignoble rivalry of the
Avantage, we are the victors and honor is on our side. Truth, knowledge,
understanding, intellect, wit, must beat a retreat and leave the field to this
almighty insolence.
Honorable people immediately make a show of mounting their war-horse,
if anyone utters an opinion adverse to theirs, or shows more intelligence
than they can muster; and if in any controversy they are at a loss for a
reply, they look about for some weapon of rudeness, which will serve as
well and come readier to hand; so they retire masters of the position. It
must now be obvious that people are quite right in applauding this
principle of honor as having ennobled the tone of society. This principle
springs from another, which forms the heart and soul of the entire code.
(5.) Fifthly, the code implies that the highest court to which a man can
appeal in any differences he may have with another on a point of honor is
the court of physical force, that is, of brutality. Every piece of rudeness is,
strictly speaking, an appeal to brutality; for it is a declaration that
intellectual strength and moral insight are incompetent to decide, and that
the battle must be fought out by physical force—a struggle which, in the
case of man, whom Franklin defines as a tool-making animal, is decided by
the weapons peculiar to the species; and the decision is irrevocable. This is
the well-known principle of right of might—irony, of course, like the wit of
a fool, a parallel phrase. The honor of a knight may be called the glory of
might.
(6.) Lastly, if, as we saw above, civic honor is very scrupulous in the matter
of meum and tuum, paying great respect to obligations and a promise once
made, the code we are here discussing displays, on the other hand, the
noblest liberality. There is only one word which may not be broken, the
word of honor—upon my honor, as people say—the presumption being, of
course, that every other form of promise may be broken. Nay, if the worst
comes to the worst, it is easy to break even one's word of honor, and still
remain honorable—again by adopting that universal remedy, the duel, and
fighting with those who maintain that we pledged our word. Further, there
is one debt, and one alone, that under no circumstances must be left
unpaid—a gambling debt, which has accordingly been called a debt of
honor. In all other kinds of debt you may cheat Jews and Christians as
much as you like; and your knightly honor remains without a stain.
The unprejudiced reader will see at once that such a strange, savage and
ridiculous code of honor as this has no foundation in human nature, nor
any warrant in a healthy view of human affairs. The extremely narrow
sphere of its operation serves only to intensify the feeling, which is
exclusively confined to Europe since the Middle Age, and then only to the
upper classes, officers and soldiers, and people who imitate them. Neither
Greeks nor Romans knew anything of this code of honor or of its
principles; nor the highly civilized nations of Asia, ancient or modern.
Amongst them no other kind of honor is recognized but that which I
discussed first, in virtue of which a man is what he shows himself to be by
his actions, not what any wagging tongue is pleased to say of him. They
thought that what a man said or did might perhaps affect his own honor,
but not any other man's. To them, a blow was but a blow—and any horse
or donkey could give a harder one—a blow which under certain
circumstances might make a man angry and demand immediate
vengeance; but it had nothing to do with honor. No one kept account of
blows or insulting words, or of the satisfaction which was demanded or
omitted to be demanded. Yet in personal bravery and contempt of death,
the ancients were certainly not inferior to the nations of Christian Europe.
The Greeks and Romans were thorough heroes, if you like; but they knew
nothing about point d'honneur. If they had any idea of a duel, it was totally
unconnected with the life of the nobles; it was merely the exhibition of
mercenary gladiators, slaves devoted to slaughter, condemned criminals,
who, alternately with wild beasts, were set to butcher one another to make
a Roman holiday. When Christianity was introduced, gladiatorial shows
were done away with, and their place taken, in Christian times, by the
duel, which was a way of settling difficulties by the Judgment of God.
If the gladiatorial fight was a cruel sacrifice to the prevailing desire for
great spectacles, dueling is a cruel sacrifice to existing prejudices—a
sacrifice, not of criminals, slaves and prisoners, but of the noble and the
free.
There are a great many traits in the character of the ancients which show
that they were entirely free from these prejudices. When, for instance,
Marius was summoned to a duel by a Teutonic chief, he returned answer to
the effect that, if the chief were tired of his life, he might go and hang
himself; at the same time he offered him a veteran gladiator for a round or
two. Plutarch relates in his life of Themistocles that Eurybiades, who was in
command of the fleet, once raised his stick to strike him; whereupon
Themistocles, instead of drawing his sword, simply said: Strike, but hear
me. How sorry the reader must be, if he is an honorable man, to find that
we have no information that the Athenian officers refused in a body to
serve any longer under Themistocles, if he acted like that! There is a
modern French writer who declares that if anyone considers Demosthenes
a man of honor, his ignorance will excite a smile of pity; and that Cicero
was not a man of honor either! In a certain passage in Plato's Laws the
philosopher speaks at length of [Greek: aikia] or assault, showing us clearly
enough that the ancients had no notion of any feeling of honor in
connection with such matters. Socrates' frequent discussions were often
followed by his being severely handled, and he bore it all mildly. Once, for
instance, when somebody kicked him, the patience with which he took the
insult surprised one of his friends. Do you think, said Socrates, that if an
ass happened to kick me, I should resent it? On another occasion, when he
was asked, Has not that fellow abused and insulted you? No, was his
answer, what he says is not addressed to me Stobaeus has preserved a long
passage from Musonius, from which we can see how the ancients treated
insults. They knew no other form of satisfaction than that which the law
provided, and wise people despised even this. If a Greek received a box on
the ear, he could get satisfaction by the aid of the law; as is evident from
Plato's Gorgias, where Socrates' opinion may be found. The same thing
may be seen in the account given by Gellius of one Lucius Veratius, who
had the audacity to give some Roman citizens whom he met on the road a
box on the ear, without any provocation whatever; but to avoid any
ulterior consequences, he told a slave to bring a bag of small money, and
on the spot paid the trivial legal penalty to the men whom he had
astonished by his conduct.
Crates, the celebrated Cynic philosopher, got such a box on the ear from
Nicodromus, the musician, that his face swelled up and became black and
blue; whereupon he put a label on his forehead, with the inscription,
Nicodromus fecit, which brought much disgrace to the fluteplayer who
had committed such a piece of brutality upon the man whom all Athens
honored as a household god. And in a letter to Melesippus, Diogenes of
Sinope tells us that he got a beating from the drunken sons of the
Athenians; but he adds that it was a matter of no importance. And Seneca
devotes the last few chapters of his De Constantia to a lengthy discussion
on insult—contumelia; in order to show that a wise man will take no notice
of it. In Chapter XIV, he says, What shall a wise man do, if he is given a
blow? What Cato did, when some one struck him on the mouth;—not fire
up or avenge the insult, or even return the blow, but simply ignore it.
Yes, you say, but these men were philosophers.—And you are fools, eh?
Precisely.
It is clear that the whole code of knightly honor was utterly unknown to
the ancients; for the simple reason that they always took a natural and
unprejudiced view of human affairs, and did not allow themselves to be
influenced by any such vicious and abominable folly. A blow in the face
was to them a blow and nothing more, a trivial physical injury; whereas the
moderns make a catastrophe out of it, a theme for a tragedy; as, for
instance, in the Cid of Corneille, or in a recent German comedy of middleclass
life, called The Power of Circumstance, which should have been
entitled The Power of Prejudice. If a member of the National Assembly at
Paris got a blow on the ear, it would resound from one end of Europe to
the other. The examples which I have given of the way in which such an
occurrence would have been treated in classic times may not suit the ideas
of honorable people; so let me recommend to their notice, as a kind of
antidote, the story of Monsieur Desglands in Diderot's masterpiece, Jacques
le fataliste. It is an excellent specimen of modern knightly honor, which, no
doubt, they will find enjoyable and edifying.
From what I have said it must be quite evident that the principle of
knightly honor has no essential and spontaneous origin in human nature. It
is an artificial product, and its source is not hard to find. Its existence
obviously dates from the time when people used their fists more than their
heads, when priestcraft had enchained the human intellect, the much
bepraised Middle Age, with its system of chivalry. That was the time when
people let the Almighty not only care for them but judge for them too;
when difficult cases were decided by an ordeal, a Judgment of God; which,
with few exceptions, meant a duel, not only where nobles were concerned,
but in the case of ordinary citizens as well. There is a neat illustration of
this in Shakespeare's Henry VI. Every judicial sentence was subject to an
appeal to arms—a court, as it were, of higher instance, namely, the
Judgment of God: and this really meant that physical strength and activity,
that is, our animal nature, usurped the place of reason on the judgment
seat, deciding in matters of right and wrong, not by what a man had done,
but by the force with which he was opposed, the same system, in fact, as
prevails to-day under the principles of knightly honor. If any one doubts
that such is really the origin of our modern duel, let him read an excellent
work by J.B. Millingen, The History of Dueling. Nay, you may still find
amongst the supporters of the system,—who, by the way are not usually
the most educated or thoughtful of men,—some who look upon the result
of a duel as really constituting a divine judgment in the matter in dispute;
no doubt in consequence of the traditional feeling on the subject.
But leaving aside the question of origin, it must now be clear to us that the
main tendency of the principle is to use physical menace for the purpose of
extorting an appearance of respect which is deemed too difficult or
superfluous to acquire in reality; a proceeding which comes to much the
same thing as if you were to prove the warmth of your room by holding
your hand on the thermometer and so make it rise. In fact, the kernel of the
matter is this: whereas civic honor aims at peaceable intercourse, and
consists in the opinion of other people thatwe deserve full confidence,
because we pay unconditional respect to their rights; knightly honor, on
the other hand, lays down that we are to be feared, as being determined at
all costs to maintain our own.
As not much reliance can be placed upon human integrity, the principle
that it is more essential to arouse fear than to invite confidence would not,
perhaps, be a false one, if we were living in a state of nature, where every
man would have to protect himself and directly maintain his own rights.
But in civilized life, where the State undertakes the protection of our
person and property, the principle is no longer applicable: it stands, like
the castles and watch-towers of the age when might was right, a useless
and forlorn object, amidst well-tilled fields and frequented roads, or even
railways.
Accordingly, the application of knightly honor, which still recognizes this
principle, is confined to those small cases of personal assault which meet
with but slight punishment at the hands of the law, or even none at all, for
de minimis non,—mere trivial wrongs, committed sometimes only in jest.
The consequence of this limited application of the principle is that it has
forced itself into an exaggerated respect for the value of the person,—a
respect utterly alien to the nature, constitution or destiny of man—which it
has elated into a species of sanctity: and as it considers that the State has
imposed a very insufficient penalty on the commission of such trivial
injuries, it takes upon itself to punish them by attacking the aggressor in
life or limb. The whole thing manifestly rests upon an excessive degree of
arrogant pride, which, completely forgetting what man really is, claims
that he shall be absolutely free from all attack or even censure. Those who
determine to carry out this principle by main force, and announce, as their
rule of action, whoever insults or strikes me shall die! ought for their pains
to be banished the country.
As a palliative to this rash arrogance, people are in the habit of giving way
on everything. If two intrepid persons meet, and neither will give way, the
slightest difference may cause a shower of abuse, then fisticuffs, and,
finally, a fatal blow: so that it would really be a more decorous proceeding
to omit the intermediate steps and appeal to arms at once. An appeal to
arms has its own special formalities; and these have developed into a rigid
and precise system of laws and regulations, together forming the most
solemn farce there is—a regular temple of honor dedicated to folly! For if
two intrepid persons dispute over some trivial matter, (more important
affairs are dealt with by law), one of them, the cleverer of the two, will of
course yield; and they will agree to differ. That this is so is proved by the
fact that common people,—or, rather, the numerous classes of the
community who do not acknowledge the principle of knightly honor, let
any dispute run its natural course. Amongst these classes homicide is a
hundredfold rarer than amongst those—and they amount, perhaps, in all,
to hardly one in a thousand,—who pay homage to the principle: and even
blows are of no very frequent occurrence.
Then it has been said that the manners and tone of good society are
ultimately based upon this principle of honor, which, with its system of
duels, is made out to be a bulwark against the assaults of savagery and
rudeness. But Athens, Corinth and Rome could assuredly boast of good,
nay, excellent society, and manners and tone of a high order, without any
support from the bogey of knightly honor. It is true that women did not
occupy that prominent place in ancient society which they hold now, when
conversation has taken on a frivolous and trifling character, to the
exclusion of that weighty discourse which distinguished the ancients.
This change has certainly contributed a great deal to bring about the
tendency, which is observable in good society now-a-days, to prefer
personal courage to the possession of any other quality. The fact is that
personal courage is really a very subordinate virtue,—merely the
distinguishing mark of a subaltern,—a virtue, indeed, in which we are
surpassed by the lower animals; or else you would not hear people say, as
brave as a lion. Far from being the pillar of society, knightly honor affords
a sure asylum, in general for dishonesty and wickedness, and also for small
incivilities, want of consideration and unmannerliness. Rude behavior is
often passed over in silence because no one cares to risk his neck in
correcting it.
After what I have said, it will not appear strange that the dueling system is
carried to the highest pitch of sanguinary zeal precisely in that nation
whose political and financial records show that they are not too honorable.
What that nation is like in its private and domestic life, is a question which
may be best put to those who are experienced in the matter. Their urbanity
and social culture have long been conspicuous by their absence.
There is no truth, then, in such pretexts. It can be urged with more justice
that as, when you snarl at a dog, he snarls in return, and when you pet
him, he fawns; so it lies in the nature of men to return hostility by hostility,
and to be embittered and irritated at any signs of depreciatory treatment or
hatred: and, as Cicero says, there is something so penetrating in the shaft of
envy that even men of wisdom and worth find its wound a painful one;
and nowhere in the world, except, perhaps, in a few religious sects, is an
insult or a blow taken with equanimity. And yet a natural view of either
would in no case demand anything more than a requital proportionate to
the offence, and would never go to the length of assigning death as the
proper penalty for anyone who accuses another of lying or stupidity or
cowardice. The old German theory of blood for a blow is a revolting
superstition of the age of chivalry. And in any case the return or requital of
an insult is dictated by anger, and not by any such obligation of honor and
duty as the advocates of chivalry seek to attach to it. The fact is that, the
greater the truth, the greater the slander; and it is clear that the slightest
hint of some real delinquency will give much greater offence than a most
terrible accusation which is perfectly baseless: so that a man who is quite
sure that he has done nothing to deserve a reproach may treat it with
contempt, and will be safe in doing so. The theory of honor demands that
he shall show a susceptibility which he does not possess, and take bloody
vengeance for insults which he cannot feel. A man must himself have but a
poor opinion of his own worth who hastens to prevent the utterance of an
unfavorable opinion by giving his enemy a black eye.
True appreciation of his own value will make a man really indifferent to
insult; but if he cannot help resenting it, a little shrewdness and culture will
enable him to save appearances and dissemble his anger. If he could only
get rid of this superstition about honor—the idea, I mean, that it disappears
when you are insulted, and can be restored by returning the insult; if we
could only stop people from thinking that wrong, brutality and insolence
can be legalized by expressing readiness to give satisfaction, that is, to fight
in defence of it, we should all soon come to the general opinion that insult
and depreciation are like a battle in which the loser wins; and that, as
Vincenzo Monti says, abuse resembles a church-procession, because it
always returns to the point from which it set out. If we could only get
people to look upon insult in this light, we should no longer have to say
something rude in order to prove that we are in the right. Now,
unfortunately, if we want to take a serious view of any question, we have
first of all to consider whether it will not give offence in some way or other
to the dullard, who generally shows alarm and resentment at the merest
sign of intelligence; and it may easily happen that the head which contains
the intelligent view has to be pitted against the noodle which is empty of
everything but narrowness and stupidity. If all this were done away with,
intellectual superiority could take the leading place in society which is its
due—a place now occupied, though people do not like to confess it, by
excellence of physique, mere fighting pluck, in fact; and the natural effect
of such a change would be that the best kind of people would have one
reason the less for withdrawing from society. This would pave the way for
the introduction of real courtesy and genuinely good society, such as
undoubtedly existed in Athens, Corinth and Rome. If anyone wants to see
a good example of what I mean, I should like him to read Xenophon's
Banquet.
The last argument in defence of knightly honor no doubt is, that, but for its
existence, the world—awful thought!—would be a regular bear-garden. To
which I may briefly reply that nine hundred and ninety-nine people out of
a thousand who do not recognize the code, have often given and received a
blow without any fatal consequences: whereas amongst the adherents of
the code a blow usually means death to one of the parties. But let me
examine this argument more closely.
I have often tried to find some tenable, or at any rate, plausible basis—
other than a merely conventional one—some positive reasons, that is to
say, for the rooted conviction which a portion of mankind entertains, that a
blow is a very dreadful thing; but I have looked for it in vain, either in the
animal or in the rational side of human nature. A blow is, and always will
be, a trivial physical injury which one man can do to another; proving,
thereby, nothing more than his superiority in strength or skill, or that his
enemy was off his guard. Analysis will carry us no further. The same
knight who regards a blow from the human hand as the greatest of evils, if
he gets a ten times harder blow from his horse, will give you the assurance,
as he limps away in suppressed pain, that it is a matter of no consequence
whatever. So I have come to think that it is the human hand which is at the
bottom of the mischief. And yet in a battle the knight may get cuts and
thrusts from the same hand, and still assure you that his wounds are not
worth mentioning. Now, I hear that a blow from the flat of a sword is not
by any means so bad as a blow from a stick; and that, a short time ago,
cadets were liable to be punished by the one but not the other, and that the
very greatest honor of all is theaccolade. This is all the psychological or
moral basis that I can find; and so there is nothing left me but to pronounce
the whole thing an antiquated superstition that has taken deep root, and
one more of the many examples which show the force of tradition. My
view is confirmed by the well-known fact that in China a beating with a
bamboo is a very frequent punishment for the common people, and even
for officials of every class; which shows that human nature, even in a
highly civilized state, does not run in the same groove here and in China.
On the contrary, an unprejudiced view of human nature shows that it is
just as natural for a man to beat as it is for savage animals to bite and rend
in pieces, or for horned beasts to butt or push. Man may be said to be the
animal that beats. Hence it is revolting to our sense of the fitness of things
to hear, as we sometimes do, that one man bitten another; on the other
hand, it is a natural and everyday occurrence for him to get blows or give
them. It is intelligible enough that, as we become educated, we are glad to
dispense with blows by a system of mutual restraint. But it is a cruel thing
to compel a nation or a single class to regard a blow as an awful misfortune
which must have death and murder for its consequences. There are too
many genuine evils in the world to allow of our increasing them by
imaginary misfortunes, which brings real ones in their train: and yet this is
the precise effect of the superstition, which thus proves itself at once stupid
and malign.
It does not seem to me wise of governments and legislative bodies to
promote any such folly by attempting to do away with flogging as a
punishment in civil or military life. Their idea is that they are acting in the
interests of humanity; but, in point of fact, they are doing just the opposite;
for the abolition of flogging will serve only to strengthen this inhuman and
abominable superstition, to which so many sacrifices have already been
made. For all offences, except the worst, a beating is the obvious, and
therefore the natural penalty; and a man who will not listen to reason will
yield to blows. It seems to me right and proper to administer corporal
punishment to the man who possesses nothing and therefore cannot be
fined, or cannot be put in prison because his master's interests would suffer
by the loss of his service. There are really no arguments against it: only
mere talk about the dignity of man—talk which proceeds, not from any
clear notions on the subject, but from the pernicious superstition I have
been describing. That it is a superstition which lies at the bottom of the
whole business is proved by an almost laughable example. Not long ago, in
the military discipline of many countries, the cat was replaced by the stick.
In either case the object was to produce physical pain; but the latter method
involved no disgrace, and was not derogatory to honor.
By promoting this superstition, the State is playing into the hands of the
principle of knightly honor, and therefore of the duel; while at the same
time it is trying, or at any rate it pretends it is trying, to abolish the duel by
legislative enactment. As a natural consequence we find that this fragment
of the theory that might is right, which has come down to us from the most
savage days of the Middle Age, has still in this nineteenth century a good
deal of life left in it—more shame to us! It is high time for the principle to
be driven out bag and baggage. Now-a-days no one is allowed to set dogs
or cocks to fight each other,—at any rate, in England it is a penal offence,—
but men are plunged into deadly strife, against their will, by the operation
of this ridiculous, superstitious and absurd principle, which imposes upon
us the obligation, as its narrow-minded supporters and advocates declare,
of fighting with one another like gladiators, for any little trifle. Let me
recommend our purists to adopt the expression baiting instead of duel,
which probably comes to us, not from the Latin duellum, but from the
Spanish duelo,—meaning suffering, nuisance, annoyance.
In any case, we may well laugh at the pedantic excess to which this foolish
system has been carried. It is really revolting that this principle, with its
absurd code, can form a power within the State—imperium in imperio—a
power too easily put in motion, which, recognizing no right but might,
tyrannizes over the classes which come within its range, by keeping up a
sort of inquisition, before which any one may be haled on the most flimsy
pretext, and there and then be tried on an issue of life and death between
himself and his opponent. This is the lurking place from which every
rascal, if he only belongs to the classes in question, may menace and even
exterminate the noblest and best of men, who, as such, must of course be
an object of hatred to him. Our system of justice and police-protection has
made it impossible in these days for any scoundrel in the street to attack us
with—Your money or your life! An end should be put to the burden which
weighs upon the higher classes—the burden, I mean, of having to be ready
every moment to expose life and limb to the mercy of anyone who takes it
into his rascally head to be coarse, rude, foolish or malicious. It is perfectly
atrocious that a pair of silly, passionate boys should be wounded, maimed
or even killed, simply because they have had a few words.
The strength of this tyrannical power within the State, and the force of the
superstition, may be measured by the fact that people who are prevented
from restoring their knightly honor by the superior or inferior rank of their
aggressor, or anything else that puts the persons on a different level, often
come to a tragic-comic end by committing suicide in sheer despair. You
may generally know a thing to be false and ridiculous by finding that, if it
is carried to its logical conclusion, it results in a contradiction; and here,
too, we have a very glaring absurdity. For an officer is forbidden to take
part in a duel; but if he is challenged and declines to come out, he is
punished by being dismissed the service.
As I am on the matter, let me be more frank still. The important distinction,
which is often insisted upon, between killing your enemy in a fair fight
with equal weapons, and lying in ambush for him, is entirely a corollary of
the fact that the power within the State, of which I have spoken, recognizes
no other right than might, that is, the right of the stronger, and appeals to a
Judgment of God as the basis of the whole code. For to kill a man in a fair
fight, is to prove that you are superior to him in strength or skill; and to
justify the deed, you must assume that the right of the stronger is really a
right.
But the truth is that, if my opponent is unable to defend himself, it gives
me the possibility, but not by any means the right, of killing him. The right,
the moral justification, must depend entirely upon the motives which I
have for taking his life. Even supposing that I have sufficient motive for
taking a man's life, there is no reason why I should make his death depend
upon whether I can shoot or fence better than he. In such a case, it is
immaterial in what way I kill him, whether I attack him from the front or
the rear. From a moral point of view, the right of the stronger is no more
convincing than the right of the more skillful; and it is skill which is
employed if you murder a a man treacherously. Might and skill are in this
case equally right; in a duel, for instance, both the one and the other come
into play; for a feint is only another name for treachery. If I consider myself
morally justified in taking a man's life, it is stupid of me to try first of all
whether he can shoot or fence better than I; as, if he can, he will not only
have wronged me, but have taken my life into the bargain.
It is Rousseau's opinion that the proper way to avenge an insult is, not to
fight a duel with your aggressor, but to assassinate him,—an opinion,
however, which he is cautious enough only to barely indicate in a
mysterious note to one of the books of his Emile. This shows the
philosopher so completely under the influence of the mediaeval
superstition of knightly honor that he considers it justifiable to murder a
man who accuses you of lying: whilst he must have known that every man,
and himself especially, has deserved to have the lie given him times
without number.
The prejudice which justifies the killing of your adversary, so long as it is
done in an open contest and with equal weapons, obviously looks upon
might as really right, and a duel as the interference of God. The Italian
who, in a fit of rage, falls upon his aggressor wherever he finds him, and
despatches him without any ceremony, acts, at any rate, consistently and
naturally: he may be cleverer, but he is not worse, than the duelist. If you
say, I am justified in killing my adversary in a duel, because he is at the
moment doing his best to kill me; I can reply that it is your challenge which
has placed him under the necessity of defending himself; and that by
mutually putting it on the ground of self-defence, the combatants are
seeking a plausible pretext for committing murder. I should rather justify
the deed by the legal maxim Volenti non fit injuria; because the parties
mutually agree to set their life upon the issue.
This argument may, however, be rebutted by showing that the injured
party is not injured volens; because it is this tyrannical principle of knightly
honor, with its absurd code, which forcibly drags one at least of the
combatants before a bloody inquisition.
I have been rather prolix on the subject of knightly honor, but I had good
reason for being so, because the Augean stable of moral and intellectual
enormity in this world can be cleaned out only with the besom of
philosophy. There are two things which more than all else serve to make
the social arrangements of modern life compare unfavorably with those of
antiquity, by giving our age a gloomy, dark and sinister aspect, from which
antiquity, fresh, natural and, as it were, in the morning of life, is completely
free; I mean modern honor and modern disease,—par nobile fratrum!—
which have combined to poison all the relations of life, whether public or
private. The second of this noble pair extends its influence much farther
than at first appears to be the case, as being not merely a physical, but also
a moral disease. From the time that poisoned arrows have been found in
Cupid's quiver, an estranging, hostile, nay, devilish element has entered
into the relations of men and women, like a sinister thread of fear and
mistrust in the warp and woof of their intercourse; indirectly shaking the
foundations of human fellowship, and so more or less affecting the whole
tenor of existence. But it would be beside my present purpose to pursue the
subject further.
An influence analogous to this, though working on other lines, is exerted
by the principle of knightly honor,—that solemn farce, unknown to the
ancient world, which makes modern society stiff, gloomy and timid,
forcing us to keep the strictest watch on every word that falls. Nor is this
all. The principle is a universal Minotaur; and the goodly company of the
sons of noble houses which it demands in yearly tribute, comes, not from
one country alone, as of old, but from every land in Europe. It is high time
to make a regular attack upon this foolish system; and this is what I am
trying to do now. Would that these two monsters of the modern world
might disappear before the end of the century!
Let us hope that medicine may be able to find some means of preventing
the one, and that, by clearing our ideals, philosophy may put an end to the
other: for it is only by clearing our ideas that the evil can be eradicated.
Governments have tried to do so by legislation, and failed.
Still, if they are really concerned to stop the dueling system; and if the
small success that has attended their efforts is really due only to their
inability to cope with the evil, I do not mind proposing a law the success of
which I am prepared to guarantee. It will involve no sanguinary measures,
and can be put into operation without recourse either to the scaffold or the
gallows, or to imprisonment for life. It is a small homeopathic pilule, with
no serious after effects. If any man send or accept a challenge, let the
corporal take him before the guard house, and there give him, in broad
daylight, twelve strokes with a stick a la Chinoise; a non-commissioned
officer or a private to receive six. If a duel has actually taken place, the
usual criminal proceedings should be instituted.
A person with knightly notions might, perhaps, object that, if such a
punishment were carried out, a man of honor would possibly shoot
himself; to which I should answer that it is better for a fool like that to
shoot himself rather than other people. However, I know very well that
governments are not really in earnest about putting down dueling. Civil
officials, and much more so, officers in the army, (except those in the
highest positions), are paid most inadequately for the services they
perform; and the deficiency is made up by honor, which is represented by
titles and orders, and, in general, by the system of rank and distinction. The
duel is, so to speak, a very serviceable extra-horse for people of rank: so
they are trained in the knowledge of it at the universities. The accidents
which happen to those who use it make up in blood for the deficiency of
the pay.
Just to complete the discussion, let me here mention the subject of national
honor. It is the honor of a nation as a unit in the aggregate of nations. And
as there is no court to appeal to but the court of force; and as every nation
must be prepared to defend its own interests, the honor of a nation consists
in establishing the opinion, not only that it may be trusted (its credit), but
also that it is to be feared. An attack upon its rights must never be allowed
to pass unheeded. It is a combination of civic and knightly honor.
Section 5.—Fame.
Under the heading of place in the estimation of the world we have put
Fame; and this we must now proceed to consider.
Fame and honor are twins; and twins, too, like Castor and Pollux, of whom
the one was mortal and the other was not. Fame is the undying brother of
ephemeral honor. I speak, of course, of the highest kind of fame, that is, of
fame in the true and genuine sense of the word; for, to be sure, there are
many sorts of fame, some of which last but a day. Honor is concerned
merely with such qualities as everyone may be expected to show under
similar circumstances; fame only of those which cannot be required of any
man. Honor is of qualities which everyone has a right to attribute to
himself; fame only of those which should be left to others to attribute.
Whilst our honor extends as far as people have knowledge of us; fame runs
in advance, and makes us known wherever it finds its way. Everyone can
make a claim to honor; very few to fame, as being attainable only in virtue
of extraordinary achievements.
These achievements may be of two kinds, either actions or works; and so to
fame there are two paths open. On the path of actions, a great heart is the
chief recommendation; on that of works, a great head. Each of the two
paths has its own peculiar advantages and detriments; and the chief
difference between them is that actions are fleeting, while works remain.
The influence of an action, be it never so noble, can last but a short time;
but a work of genius is a living influence, beneficial and ennobling
throughout the ages. All that can remain of actions is a memory, and that
becomes weak and disfigured by time—a matter of indifference to us, until
at last it is extinguished altogether; unless, indeed, history takes it up, and
presents it, fossilized, to posterity. Works are immortal in themselves, and
once committed to writing, may live for ever. Of Alexander the Great we
have but the name and the record; but Plato and Aristotle, Homer and
Horace are alive, and as directly at work to-day as they were in their own
lifetime. The Vedas, and their Upanishads, are still with us: but of all
contemporaneous actions not a trace has come down to us.
Another disadvantage under which actions labor is that they depend upon
chance for the possibility of coming into existence; and hence, the fame
they win does not flow entirely from their intrinsic value, but also from the
circumstances which happened to lend them importance and lustre. Again,
the fame of actions, if, as in war, they are purely personal, depends upon
the testimony of fewer witnesses; and these are not always present, and
even if present, are not always just or unbiased observers. This
disadvantage, however, is counterbalanced by the fact that actions have the
advantage of being of a practical character, and, therefore, within the range
of general human intelligence; so that once the facts have been correctly
reported, justice is immediately done; unless, indeed, the motive
underlying the action is not at first properly understood or appreciated. No
action can be really understood apart from the motive which prompted it.
It is just the contrary with works. Their inception does not depend upon
chance, but wholly and entirely upon their author; and whoever they are in
and for themselves, that they remain as long as they live. Further, there is a
difficulty in properly judging them, which becomes all the harder, the
higher their character; often there are no persons competent to understand
the work, and often no unbiased or honest critics. Their fame, however,
does not depend upon one judge only; they can enter an appeal to another.
In the case of actions, as I have said, it is only their memory which comes
down to posterity, and then only in the traditional form; but works are
handed down themselves, and, except when parts of them have been lost,
in the form in which they first appeared. In this case there is no room for
any disfigurement of the facts; and any circumstance which may have
prejudiced them in their origin, fall away with the lapse of time. Nay, it is
often only after the lapse of time that the persons really competent to judge
them appear—exceptional critics sitting in judgment on exceptional works,
and giving their weighty verdicts in succession. These collectively form a
perfectly just appreciation; and though there are cases where it has taken
some hundreds of years to form it, no further lapse of time is able to
reverse the verdict;—so secure and inevitable is the fame of a great work.
Whether authors ever live to see the dawn of their fame depends upon the
chance of circumstance; and the higher and more important their works
are, the less likelihood there is of their doing so. That was an incomparable
fine saying of Seneca's, that fame follows merit as surely as the body casts a
shadow; sometimes falling in front, and sometimes behind. And he goes on
to remark that though the envy of contemporaries be shown by universal
silence, there will come those who will judge without enmity or favor.
From this remark it is manifest that even in Seneca's age there were rascals
who understood the art of suppressing merit by maliciously ignoring its
existence, and of concealing good work from the public in order to favor
the bad: it is an art well understood in our day, too, manifesting itself, both
then and now, in an envious conspiracy of silence.
As a general rule, the longer a man's fame is likely to last, the later it will be
in coming; for all excellent products require time for their development.
The fame which lasts to posterity is like an oak, of very slow growth; and
that which endures but a little while, like plants which spring up in a year
and then die; whilst false fame is like a fungus, shooting up in a night and
perishing as soon.
And why? For this reason; the more a man belongs to posterity, in other
words, to humanity in general, the more of an alien he is to his
contemporaries; since his work is not meant for them as such, but only for
them in so far as they form part of mankind at large; there is none of that
familiar local color about his productions which would appeal to them; and
so what he does, fails of recognition because it is strange.
People are more likely to appreciate the man who serves the circumstances
of his own brief hour, or the temper of the moment,—belonging to it, living
and dying with it.
The general history of art and literature shows that the highest
achievements of the human mind are, as a rule, not favorably received at
first; but remain in obscurity until they win notice from intelligence of a
high order, by whose influence they are brought into a position which they
then maintain, in virtue of the authority thus given them.
If the reason of this should be asked, it will be found that ultimately, a man
can really understand and appreciate those things only which are of like
nature with himself. The dull person will like what is dull, and the
common person what is common; a man whose ideas are mixed will be
attracted by confusion of thought; and folly will appeal to him who has no
brains at all; but best of all, a man will like his own works, as being of a
character thoroughly at one with himself. This is a truth as old as
Epicharmus of fabulous memory—
[Greek: Thaumaston ouden esti me tauth outo legein
Kal andanein autoisin autous kal dokein
Kalos pethukenai kal gar ho kuon kuni
Kalloton eimen phainetai koi bous boi
Onos dono kalliston [estin], us dut.]
The sense of this passage—for it should not be lost—is that we should not
be surprised if people are pleased with themselves, and fancy that they are
in good case; for to a dog the best thing in the world is a dog; to an ox, an
ox; to an ass, an ass; and to a sow, a sow.
The strongest arm is unavailing to give impetus to a featherweight; for,
instead of speeding on its way and hitting its mark with effect, it will soon
fall to the ground, having expended what little energy was given to it, and
possessing no mass of its own to be the vehicle of momentum. So it is with
great and noble thoughts, nay, with the very masterpieces of genius, when
there are none but little, weak, and perverse minds to appreciate them,—a
fact which has been deplored by a chorus of the wise in all ages. Jesus, the
son of Sirach, for instance, declares that He that telleth a tale to a fool
speaketh to one in slumber: when he hath told his tale, he will say, What is
the matter? And Hamlet says, A knavish speech sleeps in a fool's ear. And
Goethe is of the same opinion, that a dull ear mocks at the wisest word,
Das glücktichste Wort es wird verhöhnt,
Wenn der Hörer ein Schiefohr ist:
and again, that we should not be discouraged if people are stupid, for you
can make no rings if you throw your stone into a marsh.
Du iwirkest nicht, Alles bleibt so stumpf:
Sei guter Dinge!
Der Stein in Sumpf
Macht keine Ringe.
Lichtenberg asks: When a head and a book come into collision, and one
sounds hollow, is it always the book? And in another place: Works like this
are as a mirror; if an ass looks in, you cannot expect an apostle to look out.
We should do well to remember old Gellert's fine and touching lament,
that the best gifts of all find the fewest admirers, and that most men
mistake the bad for the good,—a daily evil that nothing can prevent, like a
plague which no remedy can cure. There is but one thing to be done,
though how difficult!—the foolish must become wise,—and that they can
never be. The value of life they never know; they see with the outer eye but
never with the mind, and praise the trivial because the good is strange to
them:—
Nie kennen sie den Werth der Dinge,
Ihr Auge schliesst, nicht ihr Verstand;
Sie loben ewig das Geringe
Weil sie das Gute nie gekannt.
To the intellectual incapacity which, as Goethe says, fails to recognize and
appreciate the good which exists, must be added something which comes
into play everywhere, the moral baseness of mankind, here taking the form
of envy. The new fame that a man wins raises him afresh over the heads of
his fellows, who are thus degraded in proportion. All conspicuous merit is
obtained at the cost of those who possess none; or, as Goethe has it in the
Westöstlicher Divan, another's praise is one's own depreciation—
Wenn wir Andern Ehre geben Müssen wir uns selbst entadeln.
We see, then, how it is that, whatever be the form which excellence takes,
mediocrity, the common lot of by far the greatest number, is leagued
against it in a conspiracy to resist, and if possible, to suppress it. The password
of this league is à bas le mérite. Nay more; those who have done
something themselves, and enjoy a certain amount of fame, do not care
about the appearance of a new reputation, because its success is apt to
throw theirs into the shade. Hence, Goethe declares that if we had to
depend for our life upon the favor of others, we should never have lived at
all; from their desire to appear important themselves, people gladly ignore
our very existence:—
Hätte ich gezaudert zu werden,
Bis man mir's Leben geögnut,
Ich wäre noch nicht auf Erden,
Wie ihr begreifen könnt,
Wenn ihr seht, wie sie sich geberden,
Die, um etwas zu scheinen,
Mich gerne mochten verneinen.
Honor, on the contrary, generally meets with fair appreciation, and is not
exposed to the onslaught of envy; nay, every man is credited with the
possession of it until the contrary is proved. But fame has to be won in
despite of envy, and the tribunal which awards the laurel is composed of
judges biased against the applicant from the very first. Honor is something
which we are able and ready to share with everyone; fame suffers
encroachment and is rendered more unattainable in proportion as more
people come by it. Further, the difficulty of winning fame by any given
work stands in reverse ratio to the number of people who are likely to read
it; and hence it is so much harder to become famous as the author of a
learned work than as a writer who aspires only to amuse. It is hardest of all
in the case of philosophical works, because the result at which they aim is
rather vague, and, at the same time, useless from a material point of view;
they appeal chiefly to readers who are working on the same lines
themselves.
It is clear, then, from what I have said as to the difficulty of winning fame,
that those who labor, not out of love for their subject, nor from pleasure in
pursuing it, but under the stimulus of ambition, rarely or never leave
mankind a legacy of immortal works. The man who seeks to do what is
good and genuine, must avoid what is bad, and be ready to defy the
opinions of the mob, nay, even to despise it and its misleaders. Hence the
truth of the remark, (especially insisted upon by Osorius de Gloria), that
fame shuns those who seek it, and seeks those who shun it; for the one
adapt themselves to the taste of their contemporaries, and the others work
in defiance of it.
But, difficult though it be to acquire fame, it is an easy thing to keep when
once acquired. Here, again, fame is in direct opposition to honor, with
which everyone is presumably to be accredited. Honor has not to be won; it
must only not be lost. But there lies the difficulty! For by a single unworthy
action, it is gone irretrievably. But fame, in the proper sense of the word,
can never disappear; for the action or work by which it was acquired can
never be undone; and fame attaches to its author, even though he does
nothing to deserve it anew. The fame which vanishes, or is outlived, proves
itself thereby to be spurious, in other words, unmerited, and due to a
momentary overestimate of a man's work; not to speak of the kind of fame
which Hegel enjoyed, and which Lichtenberg describes as trumpeted forth
by a clique of admiring undergraduates—the resounding echo of empty
heads;—such a fame as will make posterity smile when it lights upon a
grotesque architecture of words, a fine nest with the birds long ago flown;
it will knock at the door of this decayed structure of conventionalities and
find it utterly empty!—not even a trace of thought there to invite the
passer-by.
The truth is that fame means nothing but what a man is in comparison with
others. It is essentially relative in character, and therefore only indirectly
valuable; for it vanishes the moment other people become what the famous
man is. Absolute value can be predicated only of what a man possesses
under any and all circumstances,—here, what a man is directly and in
himself. It is the possession of a great heart or a great head, and not the
mere fame of it, which is worth having, and conducive to happiness. Not
fame, but that which deserves to be famous, is what a man should hold in
esteem. This is, as it were, the true underlying substance, and fame is only
an accident, affecting its subject chiefly as a kind of external symptom,
which serves to confirm his own opinion of himself. Light is not visible
unless it meets with something to reflect it; and talent is sure of itself only
when its fame is noised abroad. But fame is not a certain symptom of merit;
because you can have the one without the other; or, as Lessing nicely puts
it, Some people obtain fame, and others deserve it.
It would be a miserable existence which should make its value or want of
value depend upon what other people think; but such would be the life of a
hero or a genius if its worth consisted in fame, that is, in the applause of the
world. Every man lives and exists on his own account, and, therefore,
mainly in and for himself; and what he is and the whole manner of his
being concern himself more than anyone else; so if he is not worth much in
this respect, he cannot be worth much otherwise. The idea which other
people form of his existence is something secondary, derivative, exposed to
all the chances of fate, and in the end affecting him but very indirectly.
Besides, other people's heads are a wretched place to be the home of a
man's true happiness—a fanciful happiness perhaps, but not a real one.
And what a mixed company inhabits the Temple of Universal Fame!—
generals, ministers, charlatans, jugglers, dancers, singers, millionaires and
Jews! It is a temple in which more sincere recognition, more genuine
esteem, is given to the several excellencies of such folk, than to superiority
of mind, even of a high order, which obtains from the great majority only a
verbal acknowledgment.
From the point of view of human happiness, fame is, surely, nothing but a
very rare and delicate morsel for the appetite that feeds on pride and
vanity—an appetite which, however carefully concealed, exists to an
immoderate degree in every man, and is, perhaps strongest of all in those
who set their hearts on becoming famous at any cost. Such people
generally have to wait some time in uncertainty as to their own value,
before the opportunity comes which will put it to the proof and let other
people see what they are made of; but until then, they feel as if they were
suffering secret injustice.
But, as I explained at the beginning of this chapter, an unreasonable value
is set upon other people's opinion, and one quite disproportionate to its
real worth. Hobbes has some strong remarks on this subject; and no doubt
he is quite right. Mental pleasure, he writes, and ecstacy of any kind, arise
when, on comparing ourselves with others, we come to the conclusion that
we may think well of ourselves. So we can easily understand the great
value which is always attached to fame, as worth any sacrifices if there is
the slightest hope of attaining it.
Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise (That hath infirmity of noble
mind) To scorn delights and live laborious days
And again:
How hard it is to climb The heights where Fame's proud temple shines
afar!
We can thus understand how it is that the vainest people in the world are
always talking about la gloire, with the most implicit faith in it as a
stimulus to great actions and great works. But there can he no doubt that
fame is something secondary in its character, a mere echo or reflection—as
it were, a shadow or symptom—of merit: and, in any case, what excites
admiration must be of more value than the admiration itself. The truth is
that a man is made happy, not by fame, but by that which brings him fame,
by his merits, or to speak more correctly, by the disposition and capacity
from which his merits proceed, whether they be moral or intellectual. The
best side of a man's nature must of necessity be more important for him
than for anyone else: the reflection of it, the opinion which exists in the
heads of others, is a matter that can affect him only in a very subordinate
degree. He who deserves fame without getting it possesses by far the more
important element of happiness, which should console him for the loss of
the other. It is not that a man is thought to be great by masses of
incompetent and often infatuated people, but that he really is great, which
should move us to envy his position; and his happiness lies, not in the fact
that posterity will hear of him, but that he is the creator of thoughts worthy
to be treasured up and studied for hundreds of years.
Besides, if a man has done this, he possesses something which cannot be
wrested from him; and, unlike fame, it is a possession dependent entirely
upon himself. If admiration were his chief aim, there would be nothing in
him to admire. This is just what happens in the case of false, that is,
unmerited, fame; for its recipient lives upon it without actually possessing
the solid substratum of which fame is the outward and visible sign. False
fame must often put its possessor out of conceit with himself; for the time
may come when, in spite of the illusions borne of self-love, he will feel
giddy on the heights which he was never meant to climb, or look upon
himself as spurious coin; and in the anguish of threatened discovery and
well-merited degradation, he will read the sentence of posterity on the
foreheads of the wise—like a man who owes his property to a forged will.
The truest fame, the fame that comes after death, is never heard of by its
recipient; and yet he is called a happy man.
His happiness lay both in the possession of those great qualities which won
him fame, and in the opportunity that was granted him of developing
them—the leisure he had to act as he pleased, to dedicate himself to his
favorite pursuits. It is only work done from the heart that ever gains the
laurel.
Greatness of soul, or wealth of intellect, is what makes a man happy—
intellect, such as, when stamped on its productions, will receive the
admiration of centuries to come,—thoughts which make him happy at the
time, and will in their turn be a source of study and delight to the noblest
minds of the most remote posterity. The value of posthumous fame lies in
deserving it; and this is its own reward. Whether works destined to fame
attain it in the lifetime of their author is a chance affair, of no very great
importance. For the average man has no critical power of his own, and is
absolutely incapable of appreciating the difficulty of a great work. People
are always swayed by authority; and where fame is widespread, it means
that ninety-nine out of a hundred take it on faith alone. If a man is famed
far and wide in his own lifetime, he will, if he is wise, not set too much
value upon it, because it is no more than the echo of a few voices, which
the chance of a day has touched in his favor.
Would a musician feel flattered by the loud applause of an audience if he
knew that they were nearly all deaf, and that, to conceal their infirmity,
they set to work to clap vigorously as soon as ever they saw one or two
persons applauding? And what would he say if he got to know that those
one or two persons had often taken bribes to secure the loudest applause
for the poorest player!
It is easy to see why contemporary praise so seldom develops into
posthumous fame. D'Alembert, in an extremely fine description of the
temple of literary fame, remarks that the sanctuary of the temple is
inhabited by the great dead, who during their life had no place there, and
by a very few living persons, who are nearly all ejected on their death. Let
me remark, in passing, that to erect a monument to a man in his lifetime is
as much as declaring that posterity is not to be trusted in its judgment of
him. If a man does happen to see his own true fame, it can very rarely be
before he is old, though there have been artists and musicians who have
been exceptions to this rule, but very few philosophers. This is confirmed
by the portraits of people celebrated by their works; for most of them are
taken only after their subjects have attained celebrity, generally depicting
them as old and grey; more especially if philosophy has been the work of
their lives. From the eudaemonistic standpoint, this is a very proper
arrangement; as fame and youth are too much for a mortal at one and the
same time. Life is such a poor business that the strictest economy must be
exercised in its good things. Youth has enough and to spare in itself, and
must rest content with what it has. But when the delights and joys of life
fall away in old age, as the leaves from a tree in autumn, fame buds forth
opportunely, like a plant that is green in winter. Fame is, as it were, the
fruit that must grow all the summer before it can be enjoyed at Yule. There
is no greater consolation in age than the feeling of having put the whole
force of one's youth into works which still remain young.
Finally, let us examine a little more closely the kinds of fame which attach
to various intellectual pursuits; for it is with fame of this sort that my
remarks are more immediately concerned.
I think it may be said broadly that the intellectual superiority it denotes
consists in forming theories, that is, new combinations of certain facts.
These facts may be of very different kinds; but the better they are known,
and the more they come within everyday experience, the greater and wider
will be the fame which is to be won by theorizing about them.
For instance, if the facts in question are numbers or lines or special
branches of science, such as physics, zoology, botany, anatomy, or corrupt
passages in ancient authors, or undecipherable inscriptions, written, it may
be, in some unknown alphabet, or obscure points in history; the kind of
fame that may be obtained by correctly manipulating such facts will not
extend much beyond those who make a study of them—a small number of
persons, most of whom live retired lives and are envious of others who
become famous in their special branch of knowledge.
But if the facts be such as are known to everyone, for example, the
fundamental characteristics of the human mind or the human heart, which
are shared by all alike; or the great physical agencies which are constantly
in operation before our eyes, or the general course of natural laws; the kind
of fame which is to be won by spreading the light of a new and manifestly
true theory in regard to them, is such as in time will extend almost all over
the civilized world: for if the facts be such as everyone can grasp, the
theory also will be generally intelligible. But the extent of the fame will
depend upon the difficulties overcome; and the more generally known the
facts are, the harder it will be to form a theory that shall be both new and
true: because a great many heads will have been occupied with them, and
there will be little or no possibility of saying anything that has not been
said before.
On the other hand, facts which are not accessible to everybody, and can be
got at only after much difficulty and labor, nearly always admit of new
combinations and theories; so that, if sound understanding and judgment
are brought to bear upon them—qualities which do not involve very high
intellectual power—a man may easily be so fortunate as to light upon some
new theory in regard to them which shall be also true. But fame won on
such paths does not extend much beyond those who possess a knowledge
of the facts in question. To solve problems of this sort requires, no doubt, a
great ideal of study and labor, if only to get at the facts; whilst on the path
where the greatest and most widespread fame is to be won, the facts may
be grasped without any labor at all. But just in proportion as less labor is
necessary, more talent or genius is required; and between such qualities
and the drudgery of research no comparison is possible, in respect either of
their intrinsic value, or of the estimation in which they are held.
And so people who feel that they possess solid intellectual capacity and a
sound judgment, and yet cannot claim the highest mental powers, should
not be afraid of laborious study; for by its aid they may work themselves
above the great mob of humanity who have the facts constantly before their
eyes, and reach those secluded spots which are accessible to learned toil.
For this is a sphere where there are infinitely fewer rivals, and a man of
only moderate capacity may soon find an opportunity of proclaiming a
theory which shall be both new and true; nay, the merit of his discovery
will partly rest upon the difficulty of coming at the facts. But applause from
one's fellow-students, who are the only persons with a knowledge of the
subject, sounds very faint to the far-off multitude. And if we follow up this
sort of fame far enough, we shall at last come to a point where facts very
difficult to get at are in themselves sufficient to lay a foundation of fame,
without any necessity for forming a theory;—travels, for instance, in
remote and little-known countries, which make a man famous by what he
has seen, not by what he has thought. The great advantage of this kind of
fame is that to relate what one has seen, is much easier than to impart one's
thoughts, and people are apt to understand descriptions better than ideas,
reading the one more readily than the other: for, as Asmus says,
When one goes forth a-voyaging He has a tale to tell.
And yet for all that, a personal acquaintance with celebrated travelers often
remind us of a line from Horace—new scenes do not always mean new
ideas—
Caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt.
But if a man finds himself in possession of great mental faculties, such as
alone should venture on the solution of the hardest of all problems—those
which concern nature as a whole and humanity in its widest range, he will
do well to extend his view equally in all directions, without ever straying
too far amid the intricacies of various by-paths, or invading regions little
known; in other words, without occupying himself with special branches of
knowledge, to say nothing of their petty details. There is no necessity for
him to seek out subjects difficult of access, in order to escape a crowd of
rivals; the common objects of life will give him material for new theories at
once serious and true; and the service he renders will be appreciated by all
those—and they form a great part of mankind—who know the facts of
which he treats. What a vast distinction there is between students of
physics, chemistry, anatomy, mineralogy, zoology, philology, history, and
the men who deal with the great facts of human life, the poet and the
philosopher!
