- Expect less, give more 
- Complain less, appreciate more
- Judge less, accept more

---

- Less clever, more kind 
- Talk less, do more  
- Worry less, act more

---

- Do one thing at a time, and do it well 
- Do it with all your heart 
- Do. Or do not. There is no try

---

- Focus on the important few 
- Solve it at the root, in the beginning 
- Good is better than perfect

---

- Listen more than you speak
- Create more than you consume
- Leave it better than you found

---

- Feel now and here 
- Life is soft and tender, death is stiff and dry 
- Do not expect to 'get' anything, just play

---

- More habits, less need for willpower
- Sleep, sun, exercise  
- Less money, more time
- Need little, want less
- Take a walk
- Enjoy 

---

- Canalize anger to curiosity 
- It is not personal 
- Not the thing but your interpretation bothers you 
- Do not take yourself too seriously

---

- Neither blame yourself nor others
- No regrets, learn and move on 

---

- Look below the surface
- Truth has many faces
- Less certainty, more probability 

---

- Know your limitations
- If you know when to stop, you are in no danger

---

- Lower expectations, easier life
- Give support, not advice 
- The pain is neither unbearable nor unending
---

- Would you treat a friend as you treat yourself?
- What would your best version do?

---

- O snail, Climb Mount Fuji, But slowly, slowly!
