# Emotions
- Watch them gather and disperse like waves and clouds

- What is the underlying reason? 
- Any other emotion under my anger? 
- Am I in charge when angry or calm? 
- Why take it too seriously?
- Is it personal? Even so?

- Are you more important than others? 
- Are they not also living beings? 
- Are they worthless or beneath you? 
- Does it look like delusions of a weak mind?

## Envious?
- Would you want to exchange your life completely with the person you envy?

## Lazy?

- The future is unpredictable, prepare without worry 
- Neither blame yourself nor others
- No regrets, learn and move on 
- Do not expect to 'get' anything out of life, just play


## In pain? 
- Is pain not natural like birth and death?
