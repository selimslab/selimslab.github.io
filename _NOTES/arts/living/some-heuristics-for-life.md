## Look below the surface

- Truth has many faces
- Less certainty, more probability 
- Know your limitations
- The pain is neither unbearable nor unending


## Do well  

- First, do not harm
- Focus on the important few 
- Solve it at the root, in the beginning 
- Do one thing at a time
- Do it with all your heart 
- Do. Or do not. There is no try
- Good is better than perfect
- Worry less, act more

## Now and here 
- Let go of past and future 
- Past had to be this way given all the factors 
- No regrets, learn and move on 
- Future is unpredictable, prepare without worry 
- Do not expect to 'get' anything, just play

## Good habits, good life
- Sleep, sun, exercise 
- More time with friends and family 
- [[listen-well]]
- [[speak-well]]
- Complain less, appreciate more
- Judge less, accept more

## Let go 

- It is not personal 
- Not the thing but your interpretation bothers you 
- Do not take yourself too seriously
- Life is soft and tender, death is stiff and dry 
- Channel anger to curiosity 
- Neither blame yourself nor others

## Know when to stop

- Never miss a good chance to shut up
