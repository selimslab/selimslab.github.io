Know thy user and you are not your user 

Understand your audience and their needs, identify pain

Ask about specific problems in the past and what they did about them

Design for people,

for the way people behave,

not for how we would wish them to behave.

---

Choose your audience 

Donâ€™t design for everyone. It makes everyone unhappy.
