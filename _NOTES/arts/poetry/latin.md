Acta, non verba 

Memento mori 

Semper tyrannis

Sic infit: So it begins 

Sic vita est: such is life 

"Ars longa, vita brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile."

"Life is short, craft long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment difficult."

Sapere aude, dare to know 

Solvitur ambulando, its solved by walking
