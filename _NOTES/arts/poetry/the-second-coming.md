Turning and turning in the widening gyre     
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;  
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,  
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere     
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;  
The best lack all conviction, while the worst     
Are full of passionate intensity
