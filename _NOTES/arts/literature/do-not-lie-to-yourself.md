“Above all, don't lie to yourself. 

The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point 

that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, 

and so loses all respect for himself and for others. 

And having no respect he ceases to love.”


― Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov
