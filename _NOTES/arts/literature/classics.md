Above all, don't lie to yourself.

The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point

that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him,

and so loses all respect for himself and for others

― Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov


Good speech is always clear, clever, and understood by all."

—Leo Tolstoy
