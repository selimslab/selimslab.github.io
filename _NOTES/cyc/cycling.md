I have used many basic bikes over the years. My first nice hybrid bike was a Riverside 920 with a 63mm front suspension and 42mm tyres. It was dynamic and fun. 

When I visited Zermatt, a town by Matterhorn, in Switzerland in 2023 summer, I rented a full suspension bike AM 120 for 3 days, gone up to 3000-4000 meters stations with cable-car and ride down. It was both a lot of fun and dangerous at times. On the first day, I made the town just before night set in, it would be almost impossible for me to ride through narrow, rocky, and steep mountain passes in darkness under a brewing mountain storm and lightnings. 

On the third day, I had an accident when coming down from the highest station, I got into almost half a meter deep gravel and flew over the bike. Scars on my torso, arms, legs, and a bike stem turned 45 degrees, not a straight handlebar anymore. Still managed to get down with the turned stem. Painful yet unforgettable. 

Three weeks after I returned to Prague, they stolen my hybrid bike in front of my building. I neglected to take it inside for one hot summer night, and it was gone in the morning. No cameras, no insurance, it's as good as gone.  

Then I got a XC120 cross country(XC) race bike with 100mm front suspension and 55mm MTB wheels. I love off-road. I would like to get a motocycle for off-road and touring too.
