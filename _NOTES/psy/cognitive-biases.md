## TLDR

We are all human and driven by emotion. We know almost nothing yet we think we know the best. We make decisions for the stupidest of reasons and pretend otherwise.

---

We think we are better than we are because mistakes of others are easier to notice than our own

We make ourselves unhappy by comparison and negativity

Brains love saving energy so we jump to conclusions, oversimplify, overgeneralize, exaggerate, and stereotype. 

Environment shapes us more than we think.

We like to do what is quick, easy, and comfortable over what is important.

We love bandwagons, all these people can't be wrong?

We can't read minds or predict other people yet we like to pretend so

People like you more than you know but they don't think much about you.

Availability increase liking, we make friends with whoever is close by

We regret and worry, both are useless most of the time

People believe what they want yet we still try to prove something or to change people. 

We love stories, a good story can easily win over the facts

We like to cry over spilt milk, it's just sunk cost and it's better to move on

We think our luck will turn after many losses, like a gambler, but every turn is different and no one is keeping the score

Emotions make decisions. Reason comes later and justifies.

We fear and respect what we donâ€™t know.

People want to associate with winners and avoid losers.

We think success is earned and failure is deserved but most things are so random. 

People feel envy but they wouldn't want to completely swap ourselves with another person

People generally like to be consistent, to keep commitments

People like to fill in the blanks 

We tend to do something even when doing nothing is better
