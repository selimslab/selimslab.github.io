Confident people are humble. Arrogance is a weakness.

- Are you more important than others?
- Are they not also living beings?
- Are they worthless or beneath you?
- Does it look like delusions of a weak mind?
- Why show contempt instead of being happy with using your good qualities?
- Do you have to prove something?
- Do you need to pretend to be more than you are?
