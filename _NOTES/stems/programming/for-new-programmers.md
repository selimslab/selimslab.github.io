[Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) and [Harvard CS50](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW) are great introductions to fundamental concepts. 

I think the best algorithms book for new programmers is:
Grokking Algorithms, An Illustrated Guide For Programmers and Other Curious People

Have a central repository to keep a record of things you do, your writings, your code, diagrams, .. So you can refine your ideas as you go along
