However hard you work, its limited by the time, energy, and mental power of a single person 

Nothing great is built alone, 

The leverage is to work effectively in groups 

"I've read something that Bill Gates said about six months ago. He said, 'I worked really, really hard in my 20s.' And I know what he means, because I worked really, really hard in my 20s too. Literally, you know, 7 days a week, a lot of hours every day. And it actually is a wonderful thing to do, because you can get a lot done. But you can't do it forever, and you don't want to do it forever, and you have to come up with ways of figuring out what the most important things are and working with other people even more." Steve Jobs
