We name things so we can talk about them. It's like drawing a line in the sand, it might be useful but it's artificial. Names don't exist outside our heads.   

A tree might seem like a separate thing but it could not exist without water, soil, and the sun. You take a tree and the sun comes with it 

Carbon in proteins, calcium in bones, iron in the blood, and oxygen in the air; all created in the heart of distant stars

Take anything and the whole universe comes with it 

Self is an illusion

High and low

Long and short 

Sound and silence 

Difficult and easy

Good and evil 

Dark and light 

They define and complete each other, sides of the same coin 

Now our minds are one
