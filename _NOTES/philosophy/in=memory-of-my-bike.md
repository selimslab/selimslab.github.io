They stole my beloved bicycle this week. I feel devastated. I left it outside at night, even if its locked it was a mistake. It would be enough of a mistake if I did this once, but no I left it out for weeks, and over months. That would be more than enough of a mistake but unfortunately, there is more. They tried to steal it before but I continued to leave it out. I had been seeing all those people taking their bikes home with them but it was not enough cue for me. Moreover, there was a paper on the main entrance telling people not to leave the door open because there's been a burglary in a flat. I was seeing it day in, day out, and still not getting a cue. How much more stupid can someone get? Looking at all those stubbornly repeated mistakes, looks like I have a deeper problem of being asleep, lights are on but there is no one home.
