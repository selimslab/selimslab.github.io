The present moment is all we have, no one can lose the past or the future, for how can one lose something that's not theirs? 

Then the longest and the shortest life are the same, for you can only lose the present moment

"This is our big mistake to think death is in the future. most of the death is already gone. Whatever time has passed belongs to death" Seneca

"What’s unusual about medical professionals is not how much treatment they get when faced with a terminal illness—but how little.

There will be no heroics, and I will go gentle into that good night. Like my mentor Charlie. Like my cousin Torch. Like my fellow doctors."
