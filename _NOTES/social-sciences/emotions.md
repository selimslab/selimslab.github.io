We need to be seen, heard, loved, accepted, respected. 

Emotions are like signals. Green lights, red lights. 

How I feel is like weather, I may not change it but I can choose my own actions

## Anger 

What's surprising?
It clouds judgment. Anger is the mind-killer. 
Use it to power actions, not to stress yourself 
The calm one is in control 


## Anxiety 

A tiny drop of possible trouble

Look at it, differently

## Arrogance

- Are you not yet another living being?
- Do you have to prove something?
- Do you need to pretend to be more than you are?
- Why show contempt instead of being happy with using your good qualities?


## Courage 

Doing what is right even if you are afraid 

## Ego 

Most things are not personal, not about you  

I make mistakes and that's ok 

Treat people who know less than you with respect and patience


## Empathy 

We deal out judgment to others and seek understanding for ourselves

Social skills naturally arise from genuine empathy
