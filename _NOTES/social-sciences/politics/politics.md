The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must. Because the weak don't come together and resist. The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don’t have any.

[The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/983517)

"It is incredible how as soon as a people become subject, it  
promptly falls into such complete forgetfulness of its freedom  
that it can hardly be roused to the point of regaining it,  
obeying so easily and willingly that one is led to say that this  
people has not so much lost its liberty as won its enslavement.”

"It is true that in the beginning men submit under constraint and by force; but those who come after them obey without regret and perform willingly what their predecessors had done because they had to. This is why men born under the yoke and then nourished and reared in slavery are content, without further effort, to live in their native circumstance, unaware of any other state or right, and considering as quite natural the condition into which they were born.”

"Resolve to serve no more, and you are at once freed. I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over, but simply that you support him no longer; then you will behold him, like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away, fall of his own weight and break in pieces.”  

― Étienne de La Boétie,
