The age of the universe is predicted to be 13.8 billion human years. 

Numbers do not directly register their size in my mind so let's do an experiment, a similar one was in Cosmos. 

Let's say the universe is 100 years old. 

If 13.8 billion human years is 100 universe years, then 
- 138 000 000 human years is a year
- 11 500 000 years is a month 
- 380 000 years is a day
- 16 000 years is an hour
- 266 years is a minute 
- 4.37 human years is 1 second for universe

If the universe is 100 years old, Sun and Earth are 40-somethings. 

EU is 7 seconds old, WW2 was 20 seconds ago, US is a minute old 

Rome was 10 minutes ago, Pyramids 20 minutes, Trojan War 30 minutes. 

End of the last Ice Age was an hour ago. 

Homo Sapiens appeared a day ago. 

Homo Erectus learned to control fire 3 days ago. 

Human species evolved during the last week. 

Dinasours disappered 6 months ago, after living for 1.5 years 

First multi-cellular life was 5 years ago. 

First single-cell life was 35 years ago. 

Solar system is 45 years old 

Milky Way is 98 years old    

Older galaxies are 100 years old 

A human life is 15-20 seconds at most
