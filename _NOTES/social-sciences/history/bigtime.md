The age of the universe is predicted to be 13.8 billion human years. 

Numbers do not directly register their size in my mind. So let's do an experiment, a similar one was in Cosmos 

Let's say the universe is 100 years old in universe years. 

If 13.8 billion human years is 100 universe years, then 
- 138 000 000 human years is a year
- 11 500 000 years is a month 
- 380 000 years is a day
- 16 000 years is an hour
- 266 years is a minute 
- 4.37 human years is 1 second for universe

If the universe is 100 years old, Sun and Earth are 40-somethings. 

A human life is 20 seconds, as the WW2. 

Rome was 10 minutes ago, Pyramids 20 minutes, Trojan War 30 minutes. 

End of the last Ice Age was an hour ago. 

First Homo Sapiens was about a day ago.

Human species evolved through the last week. 

Dinasours appeared 2 years ago and disappered 6 months ago 

First multi-cellular life was 5 years ago. 

First single-cell life was 35 years ago. 

Solar system is formed 45 years ago 

Milky way galaxy formed 98 years ago
