The earth is 4.5 billion years old. Let's take it to human-scale, and say the Earth is 45 years old. 100 000 000 years for us is like one year to her. 

Then the Milky way galaxy is 136 years old, and Big Bang happened 138 years ago. 

By the same scale, 

A decade is 3 seconds

a century, 30 seconds

200 years, a minute

1000 years, 5 minutes 

300 000 years, a day
