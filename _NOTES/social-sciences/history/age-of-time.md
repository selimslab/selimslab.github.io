The age of the universe is predicted to be 13.8 billion human years. 

Large numbers do not directly register their size in my mind. 

Let's do an experiment similar to the one in Cosmos. Let's scale this 13.8b years for human frame. 

If we scale down by 100 million, then 100 million human years is 1 year for the universe. 

Then 13.8b human years become 138 years for the universe

Let's take it further, 

**If the universe is a 138 years old woman,**

Then Milky Way is 136 years old, 

Sun, Earth and moon are 45 years old, 

A human decade is 3 seconds for her

A century 30 seconds

Each minute of her watch is our 200 years 

Her 5 minutes is our one thousand years

Our 12 000 years is 1 hour in her time

**In her perspective,**

The earth formed 45 years ago

First living cells, 35 years ago

Dinasours, 2.3 years ago

Mammals, 2 years ago 

Last Common Ancestor of Humans and Chimps, a month ago

Earliest signs of stone tools, a week ago 

Earliest signs for the control of fire, 3 days ago 

Earliest signs of homo sapiens, yesterday 

First cave paintings, 3 hours ago 

The end of the last Ice Age, an hour ago

All the industry, technology, and world wars happened in the last minute of her 138 years 

A human lifetime is 20-30 seconds at most.
