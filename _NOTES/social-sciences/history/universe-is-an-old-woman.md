The age of the universe is predicted to be 13.8 billion human years. 

Large numbers do not directly register their size in my mind. 

Let's do an experiment similar to the one in Cosmos. Let's scale this 13.8b years for human frame. 

If we scale down by 100 million, then 100 million human years is 1 year for the universe. 

Then 13.8b human years is 138 years for the universe

Milky Way is 136 years old, 

Sun, Earth and Moon are 45 years old, 

**If the universe is a 138 years old woman,**

A human decade is 3 seconds for her, 

a century 30 seconds, a millennium is 5 minutes to her

**In her perspective,**

The earth formed 45 years ago

Early signs of homo sapiens, yesterday 

First cave paintings, 3 hours ago 

The end of the last Ice Age, an hour ago

All the industry, technology, and world wars happened in the last minute of her 138 years 

A human lifetime is 20-30 seconds.
