The most well-known part of human history starts with the end of the last age, around 12 000 years ago. 

Agriculture, first settlements, cities, religions, kingdoms, wars, and explorations followed, bringing us to this very day. 

If we take the end of last glacial period ~12 000 years ago as year 0, now is the year 12 024. And we are in the 121st century of Human Era, not 21st
