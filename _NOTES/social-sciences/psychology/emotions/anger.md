- What is bothering me? Is it the situation or my interpretation of it?
- What is under this anger?
- Am I in charge when angry or when calm?
- Why must I take it too seriously?
- Is it personal? Even so?
- Does it really matter?
- "We suffer more in imagination than in reality"
- Why should I get so surprised? What is so unexpected?

Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate. 

“The longer I live, the more I observe that carrying around anger is the most debilitating to the person who bears it.”
― Katharine Graham
