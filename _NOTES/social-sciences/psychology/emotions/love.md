> Tis better to have loved and lost
>
> Than never to have loved at all.


"What is hell? I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love.”
― Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov

"Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new.”
