## Price vs Value 

A high price doesn't mean high value or high quality, the same for low price

You can pay a lot and get little value, or get a lot of value for a reasonable price

## Emotions drive industries 

Insecurity and fear, cosmetics, arms

discontent, envy, luxury

[Your Lifestyle Has Already Been Designed (raptitude.com)](https://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/)

Happy people are bad for big business, it's better for them if you have money but not enough time so you buy things to feel a bit better and try to make up for your lack of time 

## Impulsive spending 
Wait a bit before buying something because we don't really want most things. 

## Four day work week 

An easy way to improve both the economy and happiness 

Why don't we do it so? Because everyone else is not doing it

[Talent is everywhere, opportunity is not. We are all losing out because of this - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/talent-is-everywhere-opportunity-is-not)

Talent is everywhere but opportunity is not.

## Wage theft 

Wage theft—employers' failure to pay workers money they are legally entitled to—affects far more people than more well-known and feared forms of theft 

 Employers steal billions of dollars from their employees each year by working them off the clock, by failing to pay the minimum wage, or by cheating them of overtime pay they have a right to receive.
