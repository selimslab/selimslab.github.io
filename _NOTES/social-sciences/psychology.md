"It is quite possible that we will always learn more about human life and personality from novels than from scientific psychology”
― Noam Chomsky




## Experiences over material things

Material things have the worst kind of hedonic adaptation. They come through great toil; kept by great anxiety. 

Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben. 

What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.





## Grief

## Persuasion

Attention is fragile so keep it short and sweet, clear and fun

Emotions make decisions, reason justifies later.

Create a story, appeal to emotion.

[[negotiations]]

## Praise 

"Recipients of praise do work harder, but only initially.

Once they sense the manipulation behind the appreciation, their productivity drops

The beauty of appreciation is spoiled by the lurking intent to get something out of them."

## Procrastination

Why do I not want to do it? 

Not always harmful 

Do I think it's boring, unnecessary, or unimportant? 
Fear of failing? 
Perfectionism?
Overwhelmed?
Distracted?
Afraid?

## Relationships

A happy relationship consists of two happy people

Your first relationship is with yourself, and if you are not at peace with yourself, how can you be happy with someone else?

Successful relationships tend to bring up even little things that bother them. They don't let things slide, they continually try to repair their relationship


## Rules 

People adopt rules more easily when they understand the reason and can see how they align with their own incentives. 

"Simple rules produce complex behavior. Complex rules produce stupid behavior."



## Spot a liar 

These are not proof of deception but when they come in clusters, this is your signal

Jests, mimics, fake smiles, too little or too much eye contact

Liers may look down, lower voice, set up a barrier, pepper it with irrelevant details

Let go of your anger and contempt.

Switch to the curiosity mode.

Ask specific questions, go backward.


## Stress

Chronic stress is harmful yet moderate levels of acute stress helps you grow
