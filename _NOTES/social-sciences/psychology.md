## Disctraction

A distracted mind can't successfully pursue any activity, since a distracted mind absorbs nothing deeply 

-- Seneca

## Experiences over material things

Material things have the worst kind of hedonic adaptation. They come through great toil; kept by great anxiety. 

Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben. 

What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.

## Good and Evil 

"If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"

— Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago 1918–1956.

"For neither good nor evil can last for ever; and so it follows that as evil has lasted a long time, good must now be close at hand."

— Miguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote

This one is gambler's fallacy but hopeful  

## Gratitude 

I can find a million things to complain,

## How to start

You need a driving emotion

It could be anger, greed, fear, hope, ..

## Literature 

"It is quite possible--overwhelmingly probable, one might guess--that we will always learn more about human life and personality from novels than from scientific psychology”
― Noam Chomsky


## Obstacles 

"What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for some goal worthy of him" Viktor Frankl

## Persuasion

Attention is fragile so keep it short and sweet, clear and fun

Emotions make decisions, reason justifies later.

Create a story, appeal to emotion.

[[negotiations]]

## Praise 

"Recipients of praise do work harder, but only initially.

Once they sense the manipulation behind the appreciation, their productivity drops

The beauty of appreciation is spoiled by the lurking intent to get something out of them."

## Procrastination

Why do I not want to do it? 

Not always harmful 

Do I think it's boring, unnecessary, or unimportant? 
Fear of failing? 
Perfectionism?
Overwhelmed?
Distracted?
Afraid?

## Relationships

A happy relationship consists of two happy people

Your first relationship is with yourself, and if you are not at peace with yourself, how can you be happy with someone else?

Successful relationships tend to bring up even little things that bother them. They don't let things slide, they continually try to repair their relationship


## Rules 

People adopt rules more easily when they understand the reason and can see how they align with their own incentives. 

"Simple rules produce complex behavior. Complex rules produce stupid behavior."

## Solitude

"All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone" Blaise Pascal

"What would you like to tell young people?”

"I don't know… I think I'd like to say only that they should learn to be alone and try to spend as much time as possible by themselves. I think one of the faults of young people today is that they try to come together around events that are noisy, almost aggressive at times. This desire to be together in order to not feel alone is an unfortunate symptom, in my opinion. Every person needs to learn from childhood how to spend time with oneself. That doesn't mean he should be lonely, but that he shouldn't grow bored with himself because people who grow bored in their own company seem to me in danger, from a self-esteem point of view."

Andrei Tarkovsky

## Spot a liar 

These are not proof of deception but when they come in clusters, this is your signal

---

Jests, mimics, fake smiles, too little or too much eye contact

Liers may look down, lower voice, set up a barrier, pepper it with irrelevant details

---

Let go of your anger and contempt.

Switch to the curiosity mode.

Ask specific questions, go backward.


## Stress

Chronic stress is harmful yet moderate levels of acute stress helps you grow
