## Goals

1. Follow financial instruments like stocks, bonds, and currencies on one or more exchanges, in real-time 
2. Make trading decisions using algorithms 
3. Execute decisions by sending orders to exchanges 
4. Simulate trades 
5. Backtest 

## Constraints 

The incoming data has some latency differing by exchange, sometimes 1ms, sometimes 100ms, we don't have much control over it 

It helps to be physically close to the servers of an exchange to get data and execute orders a bit faster
