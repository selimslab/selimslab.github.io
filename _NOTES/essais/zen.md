1. Nothing in excess
2. The world is full of nonsense. It’s not personal. It doesn’t matter. Don't let it get you down. 
3. Don't take yourself too seriously.
4. Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain.
5. Complain less, appreciate more.
6. Listen to your heart and go with all your heart. 
7. Learn from the past. Prepare for the future. Enjoy the moment, here and now.
