title: Deepen your days

Our early years also seem longer because they contain so many firsts—first thunderstorm, first swim in the ocean, first kiss, first car, first real job—each of which makes the year in which it happened seem more significant to the overall arc of life, creating a strong sense of progress and time well used.

Compare that to the life of a middle-aged adult, which is much more governed by routine and repetition. Day after day, the same tasks are performed, the same roles embodied, the same forms of entertainment enjoyed. At mid-life, chances are you make new friends much less frequently, you move much less often, and you try things for the first time only rarely.
