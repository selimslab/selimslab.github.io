Respect and trust among members 

Everyone on the team should share the goal 

Highly trained and talented leaders, autonomous in decisions of their area 

Discipline, consistency, and certainty in reward and punishment 

Obeyable orders

The right person in the right place 

Harmony in team
 
Such a team is like a surgical team, covers weaknesses, and amplifies strengths. It's more than the sum of its parts
