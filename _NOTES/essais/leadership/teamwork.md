Working together towards a shared goal 

##Â Harmony, respect, and trust 

Everyone on the team should clearly understand why we are doing this in the first place 

Cover weaknesses, amplify strengths 

Respect and trust among members, like a surgical team 

Harmony in team is shown in little ways but it's no little thing

## Culture 

[[hiring]] decisions bring in the people and they create the [[company-culture]] 

Lead by example, words are forgotten but actions not 

## Autonomy and mastery 

Highly trained and talented leaders, autonomous in decisions of their area 

## Communicate well  

Explain the [intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_(military))

Be transparent and fair  

[[communication]]

## Accountability 

Make sure that every area of responsibility has a definite owner 

The right person in the right place 

Discipline, consistency, and certainty in rewards and consequences

##Â Empower people 

If people are not autonomous and flourishing in their areas, how can they be creative? [[creativity]]

## Lead by inspiration 

Build projects around motivated people

Provide the environment, remove obstacles

## Focus on the important few 

> 'Manage the top line, and the bottom line will follow.' What's the top line? It's things like, why are we doing this in the first place? What's our strategy? What are customers saying? How responsive are we? Do we have the best products and the best people? Those are the kind of questions you have to focus on.

## Balance data with intuition and experience 

Not every important thing is measurable

## No silver bullets  

There is no single leadership style that suits all, the right thing to do depends on the context and the people
