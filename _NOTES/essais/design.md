- Design is the core and it keeps expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.
- Good design resembles a likable person: respectful, generous and helpful.

* Know thy user and you are not your user

- Design for the way people behave, not for how you wish them to behave.
- Ask about specific problems in the past and what they did about them
- Test early and often
- Three test-and-fix cycles with 5 users

* [[do-one-thing-at-a-time-and-do-it-well]]

- Design is like a mom, nobody notices when she’s around, but everybody misses her when she’s not.
- Its simple enough if the user can easily and intuitively grasp how it works

* [[ship-it]]
* [[creativity]]
* Take hints from the past

- Don’t design for everyone. It makes everyone unhappy.

* Be mindful of emotions, soothe fears, use nostalgia, give hope
* Design can be evil [[hijacked-minds]]
