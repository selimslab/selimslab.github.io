Technology should be easy to understand, easy to explain because it's human-made and made from scratch. It should be something you love and understand, as in the great Lynyrd Skynyrd song "Simple Man" 

> In the beginning there was darkness, and God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

If there is only darkness, there is nothing to distinguish between, there is no uncertainty, no information since information is the difference, between something and nothing, light and darkness, sound and silence, .. 

Senses turn the differences in air vibrations or light density to nerve signals, brain interprets the signals, and we get the feeling that we understand something. All of this is pure magic and we know very little about its why or how. 

So senses and brains are nature's way to process information and the brain is still the best computer. 

Even the first people needed to keep track of a few things other and matched their fingers to objects, leading to numbers and counting. When they start growing plants and raising animals, there become many more things and people to keep track of and this led to saving numbers with knots or symbols on clay tablets. leading to letters and writing. 

Farming was a bad deal and led to a lot of work, a bland diet, more people, and more problems. Eventually to peasants, soldiers, priests, and kings. And writing enabled keeping track of all these mess. Crops, animals, soldiers, and taxes, .. 

Then came the paper and ink, scrolls and hand-written books, then printing press. Writing enabled science to rise upon the shoulders of giants, as Newton put it. Looking around and playing, people discovered the forces in nature and name them like gravity, magnetism, and electricity. 

Pen and paper goes a long way for simple calculations but they become more complicated. In 1642, Blaise Pascal invented a mechanical calculator

... 

When we do the same with computers, we call it a "program". A program takes some information and operates on it. We call a piece of information "data" and organize data in "data structures" like lists, key-value pairs, stacks, queues, trees, .. 

When you choose the right data structure for the problem, algorithms naturally flow from there. 

And we need some way to store data. The simplest thing would be to write to keep it in memory. Since a program already works with the data in memory. And if the data is in the long-term like a disk, the program first need to move it from the disk to memory to work with it. However, when the program exits or gets killed or the computer crashes, and it means all prgrams are killed, then the data in program memory is lost. So we use disks to store the data.
