Do not chase pleasure or avoid necessary pain

Nothing in excess

The world is unjust and full of shit, still there is also some good in it

Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished

Complain less, appreciate more

Feel and let go

Do what feels right over what is easy

Garbage in, garbage out

Do what you can here and now

Love is wise, hatred is foolish.

Do nothing in anger

It’s not personal.

It doesn’t matter.

Go with all your heart

Take a walk

Know your limits

Don’t take yourself too seriously

This too shall pass

Do one thing at a time

Don't decide under physical discomfort or heavy emotion, wait until your mind is clear

Don't get stuck, good enough is good

Don't let other people get you down

You are what you do

Listen really well, the listener is in charge

Do you communicate as well as you can?
