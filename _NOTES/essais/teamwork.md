Working together towards a shared goal 

## Harmony, [[respect]], and [[trust]] 

Everyone on the team should clearly understand why we are doing this in the first place 

Cover weaknesses, amplify strengths 

Respect and trust among members, like a surgical team 

Harmony in team 

## Culture 

[[hiring]] decisions bring in the people and they create the [[company-culture]] 

Lead by example, words are forgotten but actions not

## Autonomy and [[mastery]] 

Highly trained and talented leaders, autonomous in decisions of their area 

## Communicate well  

Explain the [intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_(military))

Be transparent and fair  

[[communication]]

## Accountability 

Make sure that every area of responsibility has a definite owner 

The right person in the right place 

Discipline, consistency, and certainty in rewards and consequences

## Lead by inspiration 

Build projects around motivated people

Provide the environment, remove obstacles

## Focus on the important few 

[[do-one-thing-at-a-time-and-do-it-well]]

> 'Manage the top line, and the bottom line will follow.' What's the top line? It's things like, why are we doing this in the first place? What's our strategy? What are customers saying? How responsive are we? Do we have the best products and the best people? Those are the kind of questions you have to focus on.

## Balance data with intuition and experience 

Not every important thing is measurable
