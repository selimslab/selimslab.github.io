Breathing is normally on autopilot. Taking a conscious breath turns off the autopilot and we become aware of the moment. 

There are little things to remember every day, like drinking enough water, keeping a good posture, staying calm, listening well, understanding yourself and others, and many other good ideas that are applicable in a given context. eg. [[a-good-life]]

And I have found no better reminder than taking a deep breath. There is nothing more simple and alive. It is with me everywhere, every second.  

No need to remember anything specific, a conscious breath reminds us what is necessary.
