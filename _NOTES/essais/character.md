Our actions and thoughts shape us slowly. 

"Your ideas determine the quality of your life, your soul takes on the color of your thoughts"  

"The content of your character is your choice. Day by day, what you choose, what you think, and what you do is who you become."  

Building a good character takes time and practice. 

"Well-being is attained little by little, and nevertheless is no little thing itself"

Real wealth is building character, applying your qualities, and healing your dark side 

"Circumstances don't make the man but reveal him"
