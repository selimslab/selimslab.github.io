1. Nothing in excess
2. The world is full of nonsense. It’s not personal. It doesn’t matter. Don't let it get you down. 
3. Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain.
4. Complain less, appreciate more.
5. Do what feels right over what is easy
6. Listen to your heart, follow your genuine interest and passion
7. Don't take yourself too seriously.
8. Think twice but don't get stuck, good enough is good
9. Learn from the past. Prepare for the future. Enjoy the moment, here and now.
