A space to organize thoughts 

Easy access to the content you find worth remembering 

Little notes, pictures, drawings, ..

Ideas spark each other 

Not some BIGCO walled garden but a place of your own

A home on the internet, [designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)

"Il faut cultiver notre jardin" Voltaire

(We must cultivate our garden)
