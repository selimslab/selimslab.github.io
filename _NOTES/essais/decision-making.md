We often make even major decisions carelessly

A little forethought can prevent a lot of pain  

1. Prevention is the best cure, [[do-without-doing]]
2. Make sure your mind is clear and you are comfortable. Do not decide when you are angry, tired, hungry, or in distress 
3. What exactly is the problem?
4. What is your top goal?
5. What are your inputs? Garbage in, garbage out 
6. What are your principles? Do you have red lines? 
7. Assumptions?
8. Constraints?
9. How close does your mental model for the problem match reality? [[stupidity]] is the gap between reality and your model 
10. Set a deadline 
11. Do your due diligence 
12. [[do-what-is-right]]
13. Think of the consequences, short, medium, and long term   
14. [[do-not-lie-to-yourself]]
15. [[do-it-with-all-your-heart]], If you are in doubt, the answer is no
16. It is easier to stay out than get out.
17. [[experiences-are-better-than-material-things]]
18. Don't get stuck, [[good-is-better-than-perfect]]
