We often make even major decisions carelessly but a little forethought can prevent a lot of pain. 

Don't decide under physical discomfort or heavy emotion, wait until your mind is clear. 

Prevention is the best cure. It is easier to stay out than get out. [[do-without-doing]]

Follow your gut for reversible decisions, follow due diligence for the important ones 

Do nothing against your will, nor against community, nor without due examination, nor with reluctancy 

Go with all your heart. Do or do not. There is no try. 

Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain. Do what feels right over what is easy. 

Do what you feel to be right in your heart of hearts. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know it when you find it.

When in doubt, the answer is no. 

Think twice before you speak and be careful with promises. 

Don't get stuck, good enough is good.
