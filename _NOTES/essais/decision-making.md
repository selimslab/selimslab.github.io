We often make even major decisions carelessly

A little forethought can prevent a lot of pain  

1. Prevention is the best cure. It is easier to stay out than get out. [[do-without-doing]]
2. Don't decide under physical discomfort or heavy emotion, wait until your mind is clear
3. Define the problem, goals, inputs, assumptions, and constraints 
4. Due diligence and systematic [[critical-thinking]]
5. Think of short, medium, and long-term consequences 
6. [[go-with-all-your-heart]]. If you are in doubt, the answer is no
7. Don't get stuck, good is better than perfect
