Breathing is normally on autopilot. Taking a few conscious breaths brings back control and awareness, here and now.  

There are many good ideas for a given context, like drinking enough water, exercising, or feeling the moment. But mostly forgotten.  

Is there a simpler reminder than a deep breath? 
It is here, every second. And reminds just what is necessary for the moment.
