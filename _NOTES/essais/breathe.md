Breathing is normally on autopilot. Taking a conscious breath turns off the autopilot and we become aware of the moment. 

There are little things to remember every day, like drinking enough water, keeping a good posture, staying calm, and many other good ideas applicable in a given context. 

Is there a simpler reminder than taking a deep breath? It is with us everywhere, every second.  

No need to remember anything specific, a conscious breath reminds us what is necessary.
