A life of flourishing and harmony requires the right action

Right action comes with good judgment 

Good judgment comes from understanding 

Understanding comes from experience and reflection

They complete each other. 
We don't have time for all possible experiences. 
Reflection enables us to draw inspiration from nature and other people, building on their ideas and mistakes, compounding on ages of human experience 

"Well being is attained little by little, and nevertheless is no little thing itself"
