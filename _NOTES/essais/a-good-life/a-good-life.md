The timeless question

> What is a good life? 

* Health, love, friendship
* [Eudaimonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia), flourishing, realizing and developing [aret√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete) through action 
* Freedom from pain, fear, regret, worry, greed, anger, hate, and egoism, ... 
* Peace and tranquility, [Ataraxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia), 
* [[freedom]] is not the absence of negatives but not being controlled by them; the reign of a rational mind and a loving heart  
* A life of [balance](/golden-mean) and harmony, [courage](/courage), action, and good judgment
