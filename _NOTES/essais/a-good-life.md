> An unexamined life is not worth living.

## The limits 

We live within the limits of our body, genes, childhood, our past, family, friends, society, geography, culture, and the spirit of times. 

But it's possible to do better since we can think, choose, and communicate  

> How would your best version live? 

In harmony, at peace, but how? 

## Choice 

Choosing the right course in a given context requires sound judgment 

Good judgment requires understanding

Understanding comes with experience and reflection 

Experience comes with mistakes

Since mistakes can't be rushed, let's reflect on some good ideas people have come up with over the ages  

In the end, what you do is more important than what you think or say. 

## Is it a life of pleasure?

All living beings pursue pleasure and avoid pain. 

Nothing wrong with it but chasing blindly brings more pain. 

Natural desires are easy to satisfy. After the natural limit, there is no end to desire and greed. 

Nothing in excess. 

## Thoughts affect feelings

The eyes donâ€™t see, they transmit light, and the brain sees. 

Similarly, external things do not create feelings. 

The brain interprets external input and creates a feeling. 
  
When the interpretation changes, feelings also change.

## Social animals

A good life comes with good social relationships 

Communication can both ruin and heal. [[communicate-well]]

Empathy leads to kindness and peace 

Truth has many faces, judge less, accept more

## The Past and The Future 

The past had to be this way given all the factors. Let go of regret. Learn and move on. 

The future is often neither as good as we hope nor as bad as we fear. And worrying doesn't make anything better. 

Spend your energy on what you can do, here and now. You can handle the future when it comes. 

You become how you spend your time. Garbage in, garbage out. 

## Love

"Love is wise, hatred is foolish."

> Tis better to have loved and lost
>
> Than never to have loved at all.

Choose love over indifference 

## Anger 

Do nothing in anger

There are endless sources of irritation and you canâ€™t be angry all the time. 

What is so surprising? Nothing new under the sun. 

Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter. 

[[take-a-walk]]

## Pride 

I am yet another being on a speck of dust in an infinite space 

Know your limitations. 

Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously.

## Feel and let go 

Emotions gather and disperse like waves and clouds. 

Neither suppress nor exaggerate.  

[[wind-and-rain]]

## Gratitude

All could go wrong yet only a few did 

Sleep, sun, water, exercise, friends, ... 

The best things are easy to get. 

Complain less, appreciate more

## Work 

Being busy is often a waste of time, quality work requires a relaxed and focused mind 

[[what-to-work-on]]

[[flow]]

[[teamwork]]

Work can be fun and fulfilling but it's just another game. 

There are more important things in life, like health, family, and character   

## Focus

## Nothing lasts 

Embrace change and uncertainty  

[[death]] comes sooner than we think, maybe tomorrow morning  

This too shall pass 

## Play 

Do not expect to 'get' anything out of life 

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up

> Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life.  
> 
> Now take what's left and live it properly.
