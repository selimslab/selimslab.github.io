Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly.

Nothing in excess

Nothing in anger

Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain

This too shall pass

---

The world is unjust and full of shit, still there is some good in it

Complain less, appreciate more

Best things are simple, a good sleep, a shower, a walk, sunlight, trees, clouds, wind, rain, a deep breath, friends

---

We know very little to judge well. Judge less, accept more

---

Do not chase or avoid emotions, feel and let go

Do what feels right over what is easy

Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter. Don't let it get you down

Know your limits. Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously

Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate.

---

You are what you do. Garbage in, garbage out

Do what you can, here and now

Nature does not hurry yet everything is accomplished

---

---

Go with all your heart

Don't decide under physical discomfort or heavy emotion, wait until your mind is clear

Do nothing against your will nor against community nor without due examination nor with reluctancy

Don't get stuck, good enough is good

---

Love is wise, hatred is foolish.

Do one thing at a time

Good work requires a relaxed and focused mind

Mastery comes from deliberate practice and focus, saying no to many good ideas to focus on the important ones

---

The listener is in charge

Think twice before you speak. Be careful with promises.

Say something good or say nothing

Don't try to prove anything, people believe what they want to believe

---

It's later than you think

Never miss a good chance to shut up
