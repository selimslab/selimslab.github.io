> How would your best version live ? 

A life of flourishing and harmony requires the right action

Right action comes with good judgment 

Good judgment comes from understanding 

Understanding comes from experience and reflection

They complete each other since we don't have time for all possible experiences 

Reflection enables us to draw inspiration from nature and other people, building on their ideas and mistakes, compounding on ages of human experience 

In the end, what you do is more important than what you think or say. Acta, non verba.
