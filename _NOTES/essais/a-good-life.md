Think of yourself as dead. 

You have lived your life. 

Now take what's left and live it properly.

Nothing in excess

Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain

This too shall pass

Complain less, appreciate more

Do not chase or avoid emotions, feel and let go

Do what feels right over what is easy

Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter. Don't let it get you down

Know your limits. Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously

You are what you do. 

Garbage in, garbage out

Do what you can, here and now

Go with all your heart

Don't decide under physical discomfort or heavy emotion, wait until your mind is clear

An ounce of prevention worths a pound of cure. [[do-without-doing]]

Think twice but don't get stuck, good enough is good

Good work requires a relaxed and focused mind

Listener"s in charge  

Think twice before you speak. 

Be careful with promises.

Don't try to prove anything

[[poetry]] 

As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

All models are wrong, some are useful 

Leave it better than you found.

Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.

In writing or it didnâ€™t happen

Keep it simple

Stay hungry, stay foolish

It's later than you think

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up
