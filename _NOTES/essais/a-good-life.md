Think of yourself as dead.

You have lived your life.

Now take what's left and live it properly.

---

Nothing in excess

Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain

This too shall pass

---

Complain less, appreciate more

Simple things are the best

Sleep, friends, sunlight, trees, clouds, wind, rain, a deep breath

[[truth]] has many faces

We know very little. Judge less, accept more

---

Do not chase or avoid emotions, feel and let go

Do what feels right over what is easy

---

Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter. Don't let it get you down

Do nothing in anger

Be kind to yourself, if you won't, who will?

---

Know your limits. Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously

---

You are what you do.

Garbage in, garbage out

Do what you can, here and now

Go with all your heart

Don't decide under physical discomfort or heavy emotion, wait until your mind is clear

An ounce of prevention worths a pound of cure. [[do-without-doing]]

Think twice but don't get stuck, good enough is good

> Than never to have loved at all.

Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate

Cruelty springs from weakness

Good work requires a relaxed and focused mind

Going fast in the wrong direction is not productivity

[[mastery]] comes from focus and humility

[[get-things-done]]

Only genuine interest and passion can create beautiful results

[[success]]

The listener is in charge

Think twice before you speak.

Be careful with promises.

Don't try to prove anything

---

As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

What goes around, comes back around.  [[all-is-one]]

---

All models are wrong, some are useful

Keep it simple

---

Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.

In writing or it didnâ€™t happen

---

Leave it better than you found.

Stay hungry, stay foolish


---

It's later than you think

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up
