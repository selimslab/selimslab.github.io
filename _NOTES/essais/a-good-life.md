A life of flourishing and harmony requires the right action

Right action comes with good judgment 

Good judgment comes from understanding 

Understanding comes from experience and reflection

They complete each other since we don't have time for all possible experiences 

Reflection enables us to draw inspiration from nature and other people, building on their ideas and mistakes, compounding on ages of human experience 

In the end, what you do is more important than what you think or say. Acta, non verba.

##Â Examine 

* Define what is important to you and what you don't want in life. "The unexamined life is not worth living" [[critical-thinking]] 
* Think about [[decision-making]] and [[problem-solving]]
* Take responsibility of your thoughts and actions 
* What goes around comes around 
* What you think, you become. Garbage in, garbage out 

## It's inside

* Focus on what is in your control
* Do not chase or worry about externals 
* "Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional." 
* Desire less, suffer less 

> "Very little is needed to make a happy life; 
> it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking"

## [[less]]
* Need little, want [[less]]
* Nothing in excess 


## [[do-what-is-right]]
[[do-one-thing-at-a-time-and-do-it-well]]
[[do-it-with-all-your-heart]]
[[do-not-lie-to-yourself]]
[[good-is-better-than-perfect]]
* Remember [[death]], there might be no tomorrow morning  
* "Why surprised at anything which happens in life"

## [[emotions]] 
* They gather and disperse like waves and clouds 
* Do not magnify it in your mind, feel and let go
* Do nothing in anger, go [[take-a-walk]] 
* [[arrogance]] is ugly, stay humble 
* Do not take yourself too seriously 
* This too shall pass 
* Choose [[hope]] over [[fear]]
* Choose love over indifference 
* [[truth]] has many faces, suspend judgment 
* Judge less, accept more

## Play and flow, this is water 
* Do not expect to 'get' anything out of life, just play  
* [[know-where-to-stop]]
* Never miss a good chance to shut up
