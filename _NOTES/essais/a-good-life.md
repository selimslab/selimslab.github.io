How would your best version live? 

A life of flourishing and harmony requires action. 

Right action comes with good judgment 

Good judgment comes from understanding 

Understanding comes from experience and reflection. They complete and enrich each other. 

In the end, what you do is more important than what you think or say.

It's all good but how?

All living beings try to pursue pleasure and avoid pain. Nothing wrong with it but doing it blindly leads to more pain. 

Since I have some ability to think and choose, I can do better. 

Natural desires are easy to satisfy. Once you pass this limit, there is no end to desire and greed. 

I can keep my body and mind healthy. 

I can enjoy life with friends and family 

I can explore and cultivate my abilities and potentials 

A healthy mind is free from fear, anger, regret, worry, and desire. 

But how?

The eyes donâ€™t see, they transmit light, brain sees. Similarly external things do not create feelings, brain interprets external input and creates a feeling. 

How you think about something, how you look at it, they affect how you feel. 

When you change your interpretation, the feelings will also change.

For example, 

Let go of regret. The past had to be this way given all the factors.

Let go of worry. You can handle the future when it comes 

Let go of anger. Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter. There are endless sources of irritation and you canâ€™t be angry all the time. 

Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously. Know your limitations. 

Complain less, appreciate more

Argue less, listen more 

Emotions gather and disperse like waves and clouds. Do not magnify them in your mind. Feel and let go. 

Focus on what is in your control. Don't worry about externals. 

What else?

First, do no harm 

Do your best 

Need little, want less 

Nothing in excess 

Go with all your heart 

Don't decide if your mind is not clear, under physical discomfort or heavy emotion, wait 

Embrace uncertainty 

Look deeper

Truth has many faces, suspend judgment 

Judge less, accept more

The best things are free. Sleep, sun, water, exercise, friends, ...

You become who you spend time with 

You become what you think 

Garbage in, garbage out 

What goes around comes around 

This too shall pass 

Do nothing in anger, go [[take-a-walk]] 

[[do-one-thing-at-a-time-and-do-it-well]]

[[do-what-is-right]]

[[do-not-lie-to-yourself]]

[[good-is-better-than-perfect]]

[[do-it-with-all-your-heart]]

Remember [[death]], there might be no tomorrow morning  

Do not expect to 'get' anything out of life, just play  

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up
