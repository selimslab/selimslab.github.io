> An unexamined life is not worth living.

## How would your best version live?  

We live within the limits drawn by our genes, society, culture, the spirit of times, and myriad other factors 

Can't we do anything to live in harmony, to be at peace?

## Choice 

Choice requires power, choosing well also requires understanding which comes with mistakes and reflection, and mistakes comes with time 

In the end, what you do is more important than what you think or say

## Pleasure and Pain 

Chasing pleasure brings more pain. 

Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional, and courage is a choice. 

"Pain is neither unbearable nor unending, as long as you keep in mind its limits and don't magnify them in your imagination."

Pain also builds character and strengthens the mind 

## Desire 

No desire is free. We pay it with time, health, and peace of mind. 

Nothing in excess. 

## Thinking and feeling

The eyes donâ€™t see, they transmit light, and the brain sees. 

Similarly, the brain interprets external input and creates feelings. 
  
When the interpretation changes, feelings also change.

## Social animals

We can choose empathy, kindness, and sharing  

Communication can both ruin and heal. [[communicate-well]]

## Garbage in, garbage out. 

You become what you think of. 

You become how you spend your time. 

You become like your friends. 

## The Past and The Future 

The past had to be this way given all the factors. Let go of regret. Learn and move on. 

Future is unpredictable, often neither as good as we hope nor as bad as we fear 

And we have the same reason when it comes so worrying is a waste of time. Better to focus on here and now

## Love

"Love is wise, hatred is foolish."

We can choose love over indifference 

> Tis better to have loved and lost
>
> Than never to have loved at all.

## Anger 

Do nothing in anger

There are endless sources of anger and you canâ€™t be angry all the time. 

What is so surprising? Nothing new under the sun. 

Itâ€™s not personal. 

It doesnâ€™t matter. 

[[take-a-walk]]

## Patience 

"Fear both the heat and the cold of your heart, and try to have patience, if you can"

Boredom not something to get rid of, it leads to creativity 

Treat people with kindness and respect, out of self-respect and principle, even when they don't deserve it. 

## Pride 

I am yet another being on a speck of dust in an infinite space 

Know your limitations. 

Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously.

## Envy 

We often envy a specific aspect of a person. 

Would you like to completely exchange lives? Often not. 

## Fear 

The root of fear is a perceived threat, real or imaginary

It is often fear under anxiety, anger, and hate 

Fear often vanishes when you face it

## Courage 

Standing up for what you believe to be right even if you fear  

It's the great antidote to all the pain, fear, anger, hate, and injustice in this world 

## Cruelty 

"All cruelty springs from weakness" Seneca 

[[who-goes-nazi]]

## Feel and let go 

Emotions gather and disperse like waves and clouds. 

Neither suppress nor exaggerate.  

[[wind-and-rain]]

## Gratitude

Complain less, appreciate more

## Nothing lasts 

[[death]] comes sooner than we think, maybe tomorrow morning  

This too shall pass 

## Open

Truth has many faces

Embrace change and uncertainty  

[[critical-thinking]]

[[cognitive-biases]]

Judge less, accept more

## Focus

## Work 

Being busy is often a waste of time, quality work requires a relaxed and focused mind 

[[what-to-work-on]]

[[get-things-done]]

[[flow]]

[[teamwork]]

[[decision-making]]

Work can be fun and fulfilling but it's just another game. 

There are more important things in life, like health, family, and character   


## Play 

Do not expect to 'get' anything out of life, just play 

Just [[breathe]]

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up
