> An unexamined life is not worth living.

## How would your best version live?  

We live within the limits of our body, genes, childhood, our past, family, friends, society, geography, culture, and the spirit of times. 

This is the river but where do we go? 

How to live in harmony? 

How to be at peace? 

## Choice 

The right course depends on the context

Choosing well requires sound judgment 

Good judgment requires understanding

Understanding comes with experience and reflection 

Experience comes with mistakes 

Since mistakes can't be rushed, why not learn from the ages of human experience?

In the end, what you do is more important than what you think or say. 

## Pleasure and Pain 

All living beings try to pursue pleasure and avoid pain. 

Nothing wrong with it but chasing blindly brings more pain. 

Natural desires are easy to get. Sleep, sun, water, food, sex, exercise, friends, ... 

After the natural limit, there is no end to desire. Unless you draw the line.  

Nothing in excess. 

Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional, and courage is a choice. 

## Thinking and feeling

The eyes donâ€™t see, they transmit light, and the brain sees. 

Similarly, the brain interprets external input and creates feelings. 
  
When the interpretation changes, feelings also change.

## Social animals

A good life comes with good social relationships. 

Empathy is a choice, kindness is a choice 

Communication can both ruin and heal. [[communicate-well]]

## The Past and The Future 

The past had to be this way given all the factors. Let go of regret. Learn and move on. 

The future is often neither as good as we hope nor as bad as we fear. And worrying doesn't make anything better. 

Spend your energy on what you can do, here and now. You can handle the future when it comes. 

## Garbage in, garbage out. 

You become what you think of. 

You become how you spend your time. 

You become like your friends. 

## Love

"Love is wise, hatred is foolish."

> Tis better to have loved and lost
>
> Than never to have loved at all.

Choose love over indifference 

## Anger 

Do nothing in anger

There are endless sources of irritation and you canâ€™t be angry all the time. 

What is so surprising? Nothing new under the sun. 

Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter.

## Pride 

I am yet another being on a speck of dust in an infinite space 

Know your limitations. 

Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously.

## Feel and let go 

Emotions gather and disperse like waves and clouds. 

Neither suppress nor exaggerate.  

[[wind-and-rain]]

## Gratitude

Complain less, appreciate more

## Nothing lasts 

[[death]] comes sooner than we think, maybe tomorrow morning  

This too shall pass 

## Open

Truth has many faces

Embrace change and uncertainty  

[[critical-thinking]]

[[cognitive-biases]]

Judge less, accept more

## Focus

## Work 

Being busy is often a waste of time, quality work requires a relaxed and focused mind 

[[what-to-work-on]]

[[flow]]

[[teamwork]]

[[decision-making]]

Work can be fun and fulfilling but it's just another game. 

There are more important things in life, like health, family, and character   

## Just [[breathe]]

There are many good ideas for a given context but mostly forgotten. 
Is there a simpler reminder than your breath? 
It is always here and it reminds what is necessary now.

## Play 

Do not expect to 'get' anything out of life, just play 

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up
