How would your best version live?

A harmonious, flourishing life requires action

Right action comes with good judgment 

Good judgment comes from understanding 

Understanding comes from experience and reflection. 

They enrich each other. 

In the end, what you do is more important than what you think or say.

There is no one true way to live. There are no shortcuts, no silver bullets. Every situation has a context. 

We can try to be a bit better. [[good-is-better-than-perfect]]

Here are some of the heuristics that helped me over time, 

## Pleasure and Pain 

All living beings pursue pleasure and avoid pain. Nothing wrong with it but doing it blindly brings more pain. 

Natural desires are easy to satisfy. After the natural limit, there is no end to desire and greed. 

Since I have some ability to think and choose, I can do better. 

I can keep my body and mind healthy. 

I can enjoy life with friends and family 

I can explore and cultivate my abilities

## Thinking and Feeling 

How you think about something affects how you feel. 

It is possible to decrease fear, anger, regret, worry, egoism, desire, and similar

The eyes donâ€™t see, they transmit light, and the brain sees. 

Similarly, external things do not create feelings, the brain interprets external input and creates a feeling. 
  
When you change your interpretation, the feeling will also change.

Let go of regret. The past had to be this way given all the factors.

Let go of worry. You can handle the future when it comes 

Do nothing in anger, go [[take-a-walk]]. There are endless sources of irritation and you canâ€™t be angry all the time. Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter. 

Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously. Know your limitations. 

Try to feel more, empathy leads to kindness 

Emotions gather and disperse like waves and clouds. Neither suppress nor exaggerate.  Feel and let go.

## Principia 

First, do no harm 

[[go-with-all-your-heart]]
 
Nothing in excess 

[[communicate-well]]

Don't decide under physical discomfort or heavy emotion, wait until your mind is clear. [[decision-making]]

Need little, want less 

Work can be fun and fulfilling but it's just another game. There are more important things in life, like health, family, and character   

Nothing lasts 

Look deeper, examine  

Truth has many faces, suspend judgment 

Embrace uncertainty 

What goes around comes around 

[[do-one-thing-at-a-time-and-do-it-well]]

![](/static/img/just-do-one-thing.png)

The best things are free. Sleep, sun, water, exercise, friends, ... 

Complain less, appreciate more

Judge less, accept more

Argue less, listen more 

Focus on what is in your control. Don't worry about externals. 

This too shall pass 

Remember [[death]], there might be no tomorrow morning  

You become how you spend your time, who you are with, and what you think. 

Garbage in, garbage out 

[[do-what-is-right]]

Do not expect to 'get' anything out of life, just play  

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up
