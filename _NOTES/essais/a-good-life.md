How would your best version live?

A harmonious, flourishing life 

It requires action. 

Right action comes with good judgment 

Good judgment comes from understanding 

Understanding comes from experience and reflection. They enrich each other. 

In the end, what you do is more important than what you think or say.

All living beings try to pursue pleasure and avoid pain. Nothing wrong with it but doing it blindly leads to more pain. 

Natural desires are easy to satisfy. Once you pass this limit, there is no end to desire and greed. 

Since I have some ability to think and choose, I can do better. 

I can keep my body and mind healthy. 

I can enjoy life with friends and family 

I can explore and cultivate my abilities

I can decrease fear, anger, regret, worry, egoism, desire, ... 

But how?

The eyes donâ€™t see, they transmit light, and the brain sees. 

Similarly, external things do not create feelings, the brain interprets external input and creates a feeling. 

How you think about something affects how you feel. 

When you change your interpretation, the feeling will also change. 

Let go of regret. The past had to be this way given all the factors.

Let go of worry. You can handle the future when it comes 

Do nothing in anger, go [[take-a-walk]]. There are endless sources of irritation and you canâ€™t be angry all the time. Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter. 

Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously. Know your limitations. 

Emotions gather and disperse like waves and clouds. Neither suppress nor exaggerate.  Feel and let go.

What else?

First, do no harm 

[[do-it-with-all-your-heart]]
 
Do your best 

Nothing in excess 

[[communicate-well]]

Don't decide under physical discomfort or heavy emotion, wait until your mind is clear. [[decision-making]]

Need little, want less 

Embrace uncertainty 

What goes around comes around 

Nothing lasts 

Focus on what is in your control. Don't worry about externals. 

This too shall pass 

Look deeper, try to understand the true nature of something 

Truth has many faces, suspend judgment 

The best things are free. Sleep, sun, water, exercise, friends, ... 

Complain less, appreciate more

Judge less, accept more

Argue less, listen more 

Remember [[death]], there might be no tomorrow morning  

You become how you spend your time, who you are with, what you think. Garbage in, garbage out

[[do-what-is-right]]

[[good-is-better-than-perfect]]

Do not expect to 'get' anything out of life, just play  

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up
