"Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly."

[Learn and move on](/the-past)

Consider beginnings. Solve problems while they are still small. [[do-without-doing]]

You become what you do. Garbage in, garbage out. Do your best, here and now. [[one-bit-better]]

[[decision-making]]

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think. Simple things are the best. [[take-a-walk]]

Nothing in excess. [[moderation]]

Nature does not hurry yet everything is accomplished.

Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain. Do what feels right over what is easy. 

Do not chase or avoid emotions, feel and let go. The world is full of nonsense. Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter. Don't let it get you down. 

What is the use of negativity? Don't make yourself miserable. Complain less, appreciate more. 

Do nothing in anger. Do you have to prove anything?

It's possible to channel pain to build [[character]] and strength. This too shall pass. 

> Tis better to have loved and lost

> Than never to have loved at all.

Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate. Cruelty springs from weakness. [[who-goes-nazi]]

[[happiness]]

Know your limits. Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously. 

[[truth]] has many faces and even all knowledge of humanity is next to nothing. Judge less, accept more. [[cognitive-biases]]

[[work]]

Listen more than you speak. 

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up.
