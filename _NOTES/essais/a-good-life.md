How would your best version live? 

A harmonious, flourishing life 

Exploring, cultivating, healing, enjoying, ... 

## No shortcuts, no silver bullets

Every situation has its context.

A good life comes from  
taking the right action which requires sound judgment. 

Good judgment comes with understanding which requires experience and reflection. 

Since experience comes with time and mistakes, let's reflect here. 

In the end, what you do is more important than what you think or say.

## Pleasure and Pain 

All living beings pursue pleasure and avoid pain. Nothing wrong with it but doing it blindly brings more pain. 

Natural desires are easy to satisfy. After the natural limit, there is no end to desire and greed. 

Since we have some ability to think and choose, we can do better. 

## Thinking and Feeling 

How you think about something affects how you feel. 

It is possible to decrease fear, anger, regret, worry, egoism, desire, and similar

The eyes donâ€™t see, they transmit light, and the brain sees. 

Similarly, external things do not create feelings, the brain interprets external input and creates a feeling. 
  
When you change your interpretation, the feeling will also change.

> it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking"

Emotions gather and disperse like waves and clouds. Neither suppress nor exaggerate. Feel and let go. 

## Communication 

It is so powerful, it can both ruin and heal. [[communicate-well]]

Argue less, listen more 

## Family and friends 

We are social animals, and a good life comes with good social relationships 

## The Past and The Future 

Let go of regret and worry. They are a waste of energy and time.

The past had to be this way given all the factors. Why make troubles heavier by upsetting yourself? Learn and move on. 

The future is often neither as good as we hope nor as bad as we fear. You can handle the future when it comes. 

## Anger 

Do nothing in anger, go [[take-a-walk]]. 

There are endless sources of irritation and you canâ€™t be angry all the time. 

And why so surprised? Why so serious? Nothing new under the sun. 

Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter. 

## Pride 

Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously. Know your limitations. 

## Empathy 

Try to feel more, empathy leads to kindness. 

## Simplicity 

Need little, want less 

Nothing in excess 

## [[go-with-all-your-heart]]

First, do no harm 

Do what you feel to be right in your heart of hearts.

## Gratitude

All could go wrong yet only a few did 

The best things are free. Sleep, sun, water, exercise, friends, ... 

Complain less, appreciate more

## Garbage in, garbage out 

You become how you spend your time, who you are with, and what you think. 

What goes around comes around 

## [[decision-making]]
 
Don't decide under physical discomfort or heavy emotion, wait until your mind is clear. 


## Work 

Work can be fun and fulfilling but it's just another game. There are more important things in life, like health, family, and character   

## Examine 

Look deeper  

Truth has many faces, suspend judgment 

Judge less, accept more

## Focus 

[[do-one-thing-at-a-time-and-do-it-well]]

![](/static/img/just-do-one-thing.png)

Focus on what is in your control. Don't worry about externals. 


## Nothing lasts 

This too shall pass 

Remember [[death]], there might be no tomorrow morning  

Embrace change and uncertainty  

## Play 

Do not expect to 'get' anything out of life   

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up

> Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life.  Now take what's left and live it properly.
