"Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly."

## Here and Now  

Learn from the past and move on. Don't regret your mistakes. Good judgment comes from making a lot of mistakes. Be kind to yourself, if you won't, who will? 

Prepare for the future. Consider beginnings. Solve problems while they are still small. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. And prevention is the best cure. [[do-without-doing]]

You become what you do. Garbage in, garbage out. Do your best, here and now. Do what you can and let go of the rest. Nature does not hurry yet everything is accomplished.

## Enjoy yourself

It's later than you think. 

Simple things are the best. [[take-a-walk]]

Nothing in excess

Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain

[[less]] is more 

## Emotions 

Do not chase or avoid emotions, feel and let go

The world is full of nonsense. Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter. Don't let it get you down

Complain less, appreciate more

It's possible to channel pain to build [[character]] and strength. This too shall pass

Do nothing in anger. 

Do you have to prove anything?

Do what feels right over what is easy.

Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate. Cruelty springs from weakness. [[who-goes-nazi]]

## Know your limits

Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously

[[truth]] has many faces and even  all knowledge of humanity is next to nothing

Judge less, accept more

[[cognitive-biases]]

## Decisions 

Do or do not. There is no try. 

Go with all your heart

Don't decide under physical discomfort or heavy emotion, wait until your mind is clear

Think twice but don't get stuck, good enough is good

As with all matters of the heart, you'll know it when you find it.

[[free-will]]

[[freedom]]

Think twice before you speak and be careful with promises. 

## Work 

Good work requires a relaxed and focused mind

[[do-one-thing-at-a-time-and-do-it-well]]

Going fast in the wrong direction is not productivity. [[get-things-done]]

[[mastery]] comes from focus and humility

Only genuine interest and passion can create beautiful results

[[success]]

[[you-are-not-nameless]]

Leave it better than you found.

## Life and Death 

[[life-is-not-short]] 

[[death]]

## Sound and Silence 

Listen more than you speak. 

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up.
