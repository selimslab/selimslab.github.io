> An unexamined life is not worth living.

## How would your best version live?  

We live within the limits of our past, body, genes, family, friends, society, geography, language, culture, and the spirit of times. 

This is the river but where do we go? 

How to live in harmony? 

How to be at peace? 

## Choice 

Choosing well requires understanding the context 

Understanding comes with experience and reflection 

Experience comes with mistakes 

Since mistakes can't be rushed, let's reflect on collective human experience  

In the end, what you do is more important than what you think or say. 

## Pleasure and Pain 

All living beings try to pursue pleasure and avoid pain. 

Nothing wrong with it but chasing blindly brings more pain. 

Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional, and courage is a choice. 

"Pain is neither unbearable nor unending, as long as you keep in mind its limits and don't magnify them in your imagination."

Pain also builds character and strengthens the mind 

## Desire 

No desire is free. You pay it with your time, health, and peace of mind. 

Natural desires are easy to get. Sleep, sun, water, food, sex, exercise, friends, ... 

After the natural limit, there is no end to desire. Unless you draw the line.  

Nothing in excess. 

## Thinking and feeling

The eyes donâ€™t see, they transmit light, and the brain sees. 

Similarly, the brain interprets external input and creates feelings. 
  
When the interpretation changes, feelings also change.

## Social animals

A good life comes with good social relationships. 

Empathy is a choice, kindness is a choice 

Communication can both ruin and heal. [[communicate-well]]

## Garbage in, garbage out. 

You become what you think of. 

You become how you spend your time. 

You become like your friends. 

## The Past and The Future 

The past had to be this way given all the factors. Let go of regret. Learn and move on. 

The future is often neither as good as we hope nor as bad as we fear. 

And worrying doesn't make it one bit better. 

Spend your energy on what you can do, here and now. You can handle the future when it comes. 

## Love

"Love is wise, hatred is foolish."

> Tis better to have loved and lost
>
> Than never to have loved at all.

Choose love over indifference 

## Anger 

Do nothing in anger

There are endless sources of irritation and you canâ€™t be angry all the time. 

What is so surprising? Nothing new under the sun. 

Itâ€™s not personal. 

It doesnâ€™t matter. 

[[take-a-walk]]

## Patience 

"Fear both the heat and the cold of your heart, and try to have patience, if you can"

Treat people with kindness and respect, out of self-respect and principle, even when they don't deserve it. 

## Pride 

I am yet another being on a speck of dust in an infinite space 

Know your limitations. 

Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously.

## Envy 

We often envy a specific aspect of a person. 

Would you like to completely exchange lives? Often not. 

## [[hope]] 

"A ship shouldn't ride on a single anchor nor life on a single hope" Epictetus 

"It won't be as good as you hope, neither as bad as you fear"

## Fear 

The root of fear is a perceived threat, real or imaginary

It is often fear under anxiety, anger, and hate 

Fear often vanishes when you face it

## Courage 

Standing up for what you believe to be right even if you fear  

It gets stronger every time you choose courage over fear 

It's the great antidote to injustice, pain, fear, anger, hate, and suffering in the world 

## Cruelty 

"All cruelty springs from weakness" Seneca 

[[who-goes-nazi]]


## Boredom 

It's not something to get rid of, boredom is the seed of creativity 

## Feel and let go 

Emotions gather and disperse like waves and clouds. 

Neither suppress nor exaggerate.  

[[wind-and-rain]]

## Gratitude

Complain less, appreciate more

## Nothing lasts 

[[death]] comes sooner than we think, maybe tomorrow morning  

This too shall pass 

## Open

Truth has many faces

Embrace change and uncertainty  

[[critical-thinking]]

[[cognitive-biases]]

Judge less, accept more

## Focus

## Work 

Being busy is often a waste of time, quality work requires a relaxed and focused mind 

[[what-to-work-on]]

[[get-things-done]]

[[flow]]

[[teamwork]]

[[decision-making]]

Work can be fun and fulfilling but it's just another game. 

There are more important things in life, like health, family, and character   

## Just [[breathe]]

Is there a simpler reminder? 

Always here and reminds what is necessary here and now.

## Play 

Do not expect to 'get' anything out of life, just play 

[[know-where-to-stop]]

Never miss a good chance to shut up

> Now take what's left and live it properly.
