I write my notes in markdown files. 

Each file has a unique name. Files can link to each other by their names with markdown links or wikilinks. Files can also tag to each other in markdown front-matter, eg. 

Group them in folders. No nested folders. Folders have short names like psy, math, lit, ux. Short names makes it easy to use them as tags. The psy folder has a psychology.md so there will be a /psychology path in the published website listing all files linking to psychology.

I use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to turn markdown to html. I deploy to github pages.
