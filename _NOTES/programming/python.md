A pragmatic language, values your time over the machine's time and it makes sense for many kind of problems 

Its a tool just like other tools but a tool I enjoy to use

It gets out of your way and enables you to express yourself comfortably 

After a while it starts to feel like speaking plain English

There is a drawback with flexible and expressive languages like Python, Ruby, or Lisp, they don't enforce rules and structure so its easy to do things in clever and convoluted ways 

So it requires self discipline from the team to keep a project well organized, readable, and maintainable 

For example list comprehensions brings great expressive power, but power comes with responsibility, and in a large enough team, if the language is not enforcing responsibility, you will see people writing unnecessarily complicated list comprehensions 

Static type checking with mypy made it easier to build larger projects with Python, 
also the tooling is good for formatting the style, linting, sorting imports, etc.
