	How the probability of an event changes with new information? 

    Let little dashes represent the probabilities of events A and B

    A - - -

    B     - - - - 

    Only 1 dash is intersecting 

If you know A happened, then the probability of B given A becomes

    P(B|A) = P(A & B) / P(B) = 1/4

similarly 

    P(A|B) = P(A & B) / P(A)

Leading to [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) 

    P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(B) / P(A)
