We name things so we can talk about them.  It's useful but artificial since names don't exist outside our minds. 

A tree might seem like a separate thing but it could not exist without water, soil, and the sun. You take a tree and the sun comes with it 

Carbon in proteins, calcium in bones, iron in the blood, and oxygen in the air; all created in the heart of stars

Take anything and the whole universe comes with it

You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars

High and low

Long and short 

Sound and silence 

Difficult and easy

Good and evil 

Dark and light 

They define and complete each other, they are sides of the same coin 

Now our minds are one
