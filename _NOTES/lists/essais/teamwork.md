However hard you work, the results are limited by a single person.

Nothing great is built alone but by working effectively in groups.

A team in harmony covers weaknesses and amplifies strengths.

- Almost everything is people and communication. 

- Everyone on the team should clearly understand why we are doing this in the first place

- Explain the [intent](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_(military)>)

- People trust surgical teams with their lives because everyone in the team is an expert in their job, they trust each other and work together, leading to unparalleled professional prowess

- [[mastery]] and [[respect]] lead to [[trust]], trust leads to autonomy and harmony

- [[company-culture]] is a result of [[hiring]] decisions

- Lead by example, words are forgotten but actions not

- Highly trained and talented leaders, autonomous in decisions of their area

- Make sure that every area of responsibility has a definite owner

- Consistency and certainty in rewards and consequences

- The right person in the right place

- Due diligence

- Empower people. If people are not autonomous and empowered in their areas, how can you expect [[creativity]]?

- Lead by inspiration

- Build projects around motivated people. Provide the environment, remove obstacles

- Focus on the important few

> 'Manage the top line, and the bottom line will follow.' What's the top line? It's things like, why are we doing this in the first place? What's our strategy? What are customers saying? How responsive are we? Do we have the best products and the best people? Those are the kind of questions you have to focus on.

- Balance data with intuition and experience

- Not every important thing is measurable
- Goodhart's law: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

## What not to do

- Trying to prove your worth
- Insecurity
- Micromanaging
- Not delegating
- Competing with reports
- Complaining
- Treating people like kids, the workplace is not day-care

- Single management style, mostly the style in which you prefer to be managed
- Hiring people like yourself

- Being all-business, viewing people as "resources"

- Impatience
