"Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly."

[Learn and move on](/the-past)

[[one-bit-better]]  

Consider beginnings. Solve problems while they are still small.

Nothing in excess. Simple things are the best. 

Neither chase nor avoid emotions, feel and let go. 

Do what feels right over what is easy.

Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain.  

Do nothing in anger. The world is full of nonsense. Itâ€™s not personal. It doesnâ€™t matter. Don't let it get you down. 

Complain less, appreciate more. 

Channel your pain to build strength. This too shall pass.

Truth has many faces. Even all the knowledge of humanity is next to nothing. Judge less, accept more. 

Listen more than you speak. Know your limits. Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously. 

Never miss a good chance to shut up.
