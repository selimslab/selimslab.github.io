"Your ideas determine the quality of your life, your soul takes on the color of your thoughts"  

Real wealth is building character. Applying your qualities. Healing your wounds. Understanding your dark side.

"The content of your character is your choice. Day by day, what you choose, what you think, and what you do is who you become."  

"Well-being is attained little by little, and nevertheless is no little thing itself"

"Circumstances don't make the man but reveal him"
