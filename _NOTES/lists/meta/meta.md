## Shortcuts
This website works without a mouse too  

- `Arrow keys < >` go back/forward 
- `Shift+S` search
- `Shift+P` go to a random page 


## Why no authors? 
I omitted the authors of most quotes and paintings since, 
1. they are easily accessible public information
2. when you don't attribute, you can't misattribute
