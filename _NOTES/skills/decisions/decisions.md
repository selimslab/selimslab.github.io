## See it for what it is 

Check your assumptions and cognitive biases 

Check for exaggeration, like too much negativity or optimism

Often it's not black and white but a spectrum 

Remove the layers, look at the core, the essence

Discuss with people you trust and people with relevant experience 

Look at it from different angles and perspectives

## Prevention is the best

A little forethought can prevent a lot of pain. It's easier staying out than getting out. 

## Listen to both heart and mind 

Follow your gut for reversible decisions, follow due diligence for the important ones 

## Consider your principles 

> Do nothing against your will,  
> nor against community,  
> nor without due examination,  
> nor with reluctancy  

Think twice before you speak. 

Be careful with promises. 

Do what feels right in your heart of hearts, over what is easy. 

Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain.

## Wait until your mind is clear. 

You may be sleepless, hungry, tired, angry, in pain, ..

Don't decide under physical discomfort or heavy emotion

## Don't get stuck

An ok decision today is often better than a perfect one tomorrow

## Do or do not. There is no try. 

Once you decide, follow through with a high spirit and persistence.
