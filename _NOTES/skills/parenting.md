Lead by example, actions matter more than words

## Be patient

Let a child be angry 

Remember that they are children and you are the adult

## They love responsibility 

Take them seriously and treat them with respect. It makes them feel like grown-ups and they love it. If you have a rule, explain the reason. 

This way, they learn responsibility, how to solve problems, how to manage things on their own.

### Old enough 

In Japan, small children take the subway and run errands alone, no parent in sight. The reason why has more to do with social trust than self-reliance.

It’s a common sight on Japanese mass transit: children troop through train cars, singly or in small groups, looking for seats.

Parents in Japan regularly send their kids out into the world at a very young age. A popular television show called Hajimete no Otsukai, or My First Errand, features children as young as two or three being sent out to do a task for their family. As they tentatively make their way to the greengrocer or bakery, their progress is secretly filmed by a camera crew. The show has been running for more than 25 years.

“When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.”
― Mark Twain
