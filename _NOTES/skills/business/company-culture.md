[[company-culture]] is a result of [[hiring]] decisions

In toxic cultures, people get promoted for results even if they destroy relationships. Abuse is a price to pay for high performance.

"In healthy cultures, no level of individual excellence justifies undermining people. You're not a high performer if you don't elevate others."

Adam Grant 

"If they are working in an environment where excellence is expected, then they will do excellent work without anything but self-motivation. I'm talking about an environment in which excellence is noticed and respected and is in the culture. If you have that, you don't have to tell people to do excellent work. They understand it from their surroundings."

Steve Jobs
