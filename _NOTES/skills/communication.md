Listen with a beginner's mind. Set aside your opinion. 

Listen to understand, not to answer, not to offer solutions

Suspend judgment, it's not personal, not about you. Argue less, listen more 

Listen to what isn't being said, too

Words are irreversible. Think twice before you speak. Be careful with promises

Avoid negativity, judging, excuses, exaggeration, or gossip 

Emotions drive the conversation. Have a positive, constructive attitude. 

Don't try to prove anything, people believe what they want to believe. 

Say something good or say nothing.

Don't say it if you don't believe it

People can't read minds. Something being obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to them 

People often share a problem or vulnerability for emotional support, not for advice or solutions

Frequent sharing organizes thoughts
