People learn when they’re surprised

It's an art and only genuine interest and passion create beautiful art

Beginner’s Mind -> "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few."

"Learning should take place when it is needed, when the learner is interested, not according to some arbitrary, fixed schedule”
― Donald A. Norman, Emotional Design


Spaced repetition

Deliberate practice

Separate work from leisure

No arbitrary, fixed schedule

"The whole educational and professional training system is a very elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too independent, and who think for themselves, and who don't know how to be submissive, and so on -- because they're dysfunctional to the institutions.”
― Noam Chomsky
