In writing or people say it didn't happen when it is convenient

Taking something from 0 to 1 creates value, and so does taking it from 1 to 10 

Companies keep competitors busy by releasing all kinds of crap so people spend their energy to keep up instead of focusing on what is important. Don't get distracted. 

Do business with people you like. It's great.

## Hiring 

Hire people you trust and respect 

Don't hire people you wouldn't work for

"Recruiting is hard. It's just finding the needles in the haystack. We do it ourselves and we spend a lot of time at it. I've participated in the hiring of maybe 5,000-plus people in my life. So I take it very seriously. You can't know enough in a one-hour interview. So, in the end, it's ultimately based on your gut. How do I feel about this person? What are they like when they're challenged? Why are they here? I ask everybody: 'Why are you here?' The answers themselves are not what you're looking for. It's the meta-data." Steve Jobs 

## Culture 

People creates the culture

Show when you appreciate or disagree

Actions are louder than words
