94b light years 

size of milkway, 100k light years

the milkway/universe 

    1e5 / 1e11 ~ 1e-6 in dia 
    
    ~ 1e-18 in vol


8.317 light-minutes, distance between Earth and the Sun 

1 year 8766 hours, 31.5m secs, 500k minutes

sun-earth distance/galaxy 

    8 minutes / 100k years  ~ 8 / 1e5 0.5 e5 ~ 16/e10 ~ 1e-9 

    ~ 1e-9 in dia 

    ~ 1e-27 in vol 

so the sun-earth distance is like a nanometre for the galaxy 


diameter of earth = 0.0425501031 light seconds

100k ly ~ 3e12 light seconds 

earth/the galaxy 

    4e-2 / 3e12 ~ 1e-14 in dia
    
    1e-42 in volume 


volume of earth/the observable universe
    1e-20 in dia 
    1e-60 in vol 

dia of earth = 12 756 km  ~ 1e8 m

if the universe diameter was the size of the earth, 

the earths dia would be  

    1e8 m * 1e-20 = 1e-12 m 

a hydrogen atom's dia is ~ 1e-10 and its nucleus ~ 1e-15, on the order of a fermi 

so if universe was earth-sized, earth would be 1% of an hydrogen atom

then if universe was sun-sized, earth would be the size of an hydrogen atom  

1.28 Light Seconds for Earth to Moon

28 000 light-years, sun to the center of milkway 

200b galaxies at least
