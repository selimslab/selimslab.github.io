## tldr

We are all human and driven by emotion. We know almost nothing yet think we know the best. We make decisions for the stupidest of reasons and pretend otherwise 

---

We think we are better than we are because mistakes of others are easier to notice than our own 

Environment shapes us 

Brains love saving energy so we jump to conclusions, oversimplify, overgeneralize, exaggerate, and stereotype. We like to do what is quick, easy, and comfortable over what is important. 

We love bandwagons, all these people can't be wrong?

We can't read minds or predict other people yet we like to pretend so 

Availability increase liking, we make friends with whoever is close by 

We regret over the past, worry or hope about the future. Yet we fail to learn from the past and the future turns out neither that good or that bad 

People believe what they want, not what is true, yet we still try to prove something or to change people. And we love stories, a good story can easily win over the facts 

We like to cry over spilt milk, it's just sunk cost and it's better to move on 

We think our luck will turn after many losses, like a gambler, but every turn is different and no one is keeping the score 

Emotions make decisions. Reason comes later and justifies.

People like you more than you know but they don't think much about you. 

We fear and respect what we donâ€™t know. 

We think success is earned and failure is deserved but most things are so random. Yet, people want to associate with winners and avoid losers.

We feel envy but we wouldn't want to completely swap ourselves with another person 

People generally like to be consistent and keep commitments

We tend to do something even when doing nothing is better
