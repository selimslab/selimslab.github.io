## Goals 

1. Follow online products 
2. Generate analytics and recommendations 

## Assumptions 

## Domain 

We need a way to collect the products daily and store them somewhere 

1. Get a URL as an input
2. Follow the links and generate a document tree 
3. Parse the HTMLs and generate products
4. Process and store 

Then other systems can consume them to generate analytics and recommendations

For example 
1. Group products by IDs
2. Join the remaining ones to existing groups by similarity of features like name, brand, price, photo, etc
