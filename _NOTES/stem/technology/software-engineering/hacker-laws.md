## Keep it simple 

* Simple solutions are more likely to be correct. Occam's Razor

* YAGNI 

* KISS 

* Nirvana Fallacy, gold-plating

* A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. Gall's Law

* Do not overthink 

* The best code is no code

* Do one thing and do it well 

* Get end-to-end first 

* Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Donald Knuth

* Decision time grows logarithmically with the number of options you can choose from. Hick's Law

* Humans can comfortably maintain up to 150 stable relationships. Dunbar's Number

* With a sufficient number of users of an API, all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody. Hyrum's Law (The Law of Implicit Interfaces)

* The technical boundaries of a system will reflect the structure of the organization. Conway's Law

* The Law of Demeter,  "The Principle of Least Knowledge"

* The Pareto Principle (The 80/20 Rule)

* 20% of a system creates 80% of its value  

* Ship it

## Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. 

* There is a certain amount of complexity in a system that cannot be reduced. The Law of Conservation of Complexity (Tesler's Law)

* All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky. 

* If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. 

* Chesterton's Fence: Don't take down a fence unless you know why it is put up. 


## Leave it better than you found. 

* The Broken Windows Theory: Visible signs of lack of care in an environment lead to further and more serious deterioration. 

* Get feedback early and often 

* Test early and often 

* Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

## Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. 

* Brandolini's law: The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it. 

* It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take this into account 

* Work expands to fill the time available for its completion. Parkinson's Law

* Cheops law: Nothing ever gets built on schedule or within budget.

* Adding human resources to a late software development project makes it later. Brooks' Law

## Stay hungry, stay foolish  

* Incompetent people think they are the best. The Dunning-Kruger Effect

* Companies tend to systematically promote incompetent employees to management to get them out of the workflow. The Dilbert Principle

* People in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence". The Peter Principle

* Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution. The Shirky Principle

## Don't get carried away   

* When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Goodhart's Law

* We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. The Hype Cycle & Amara's Law
