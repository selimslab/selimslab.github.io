A little forethought can prevent a lot of pain 

## Figure out what to work on 

1. define the problem 
2. define constrainsts
3. state assumptions 
4. ask questions and refine hypothesis
5. iterate until you have a relatively clear problem definition, constrainsts, and assumptions

## Figure out how 

1. write a design doc, draw main components 
2. circulate the design doc
3. iterate on this process until it settles to a relatively stable state 
4. write the readme before the code 
5. write the tests before code 

## Execute 

1. Start small with units doing one thing well, and compose them 
2. In this process, the team will realize many unforeseen sides of the problem, 
3. Iterate on your componenets and their interactions until you have a good enough solution for your high level problem

The key ideas are 
1. consider beginnings
2. look before leap 
3. get feedback early and often 
3. iterate
