A little forethought can prevent a lot of pain 

0. Start with the design doc, a readme is great for this 
1. Define the problem, "A problem well-stated is a problem half-solved"
2. Define constraints
3. State assumptions 
4. Ask questions and refine hypothesis
5. Draw main components 
6. Circulate the design doc and iterate until you have a clear problem definition, constraints, and assumptions
7. Write tests before the code, mostly integration and behavioral, the contract of the program. This will also reveal some gaps in the initial design 
8. Start with small units doing one thing well and compose them 
9. Iterate until you have a good enough solution for your high-level problem   


The key ideas are 
1. Consider beginnings
2. Get feedback early and often 
3. Iterate
