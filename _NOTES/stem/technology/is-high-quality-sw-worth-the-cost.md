Summing all of this up:

Neglecting internal quality leads to rapid build up of cruft

This cruft slows down feature development

Even a great team produces cruft, but by keeping internal quality high, is able to keep it under control

High internal quality keeps cruft to a minimum, allowing a team to add features with less effort, time, and cost.
