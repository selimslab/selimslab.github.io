If you believe something hard is impossible, you wonâ€™t even try

What are people afraid to talk about, what is forbidden, what are taboos?

No secrets would mean a perfect society, no hidden injustice, perfect nutrition, transportation, shelter, perfect access to information, smooth government, happy children, perfect security, healthcare, food, water, shelter, internet for everyone etc..
