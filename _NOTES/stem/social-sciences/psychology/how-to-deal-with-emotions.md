Watch them gather and disperse like waves and clouds 

Anger, arrogance, and desire make you their slave, choose freedom 

## Angry? 
- What is bothering me? Is it the situation or my interpretation of it? 
- Does it **really** matter?
- What is the underlying reason? 
- Any other emotion under my anger? 
- Am I in charge when angry or calm? 
- Why take it too seriously?
- Is it personal? Even so? 

## Arrogant? 
- Are you more important than others? 
- Are they not also living beings? 
- Are they worthless or beneath you? 
- Does it look like delusions of a weak mind? 
- Why show contempt instead of being happy with using your good qualities?

## Desiring?
- If you can get it without harm, go for it 
- No desire is free, you pay with your life and peace of mind 
- Need little, want less

## Envious?
- Would you want to exchange your life completely with the person you envy?

## Lazy?
- How delightful is it to use my talent and energy?

## Overthinking? 
- Let go of the past and the future 
- The past had to be this way given all the factors 
- The future is unpredictable, prepare without worry 
- Neither blame yourself nor others
- No regrets, learn and move on 
- Do not expect to 'get' anything out of life, just play


## In pain? 
- Is pain not natural like birth and death? 
- Is it unbearable? 
- Is it unending? 
- Is this the worst possible pain? 
- Can I use pain to refine my courage and strength of mind?
