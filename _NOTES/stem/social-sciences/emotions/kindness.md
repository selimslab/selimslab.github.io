To be considerate and humane

To take responsibility for your actions on other people 

We have a choice, we can hurt people or heal them 

---

Treat people with kindness and respect,

out of self-respect and principle

even when they don't deserve it, 

Be kind, not clever

"It takes years to become a great engineer, designer, writer, or painter

But it only takes days to become communicative, reliable, and nice to be around"
