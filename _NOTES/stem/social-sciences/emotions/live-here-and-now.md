- Complain less, appreciate more
- Judge less, accept more

- Let go of the past and the future 

- The past had to be this way given all the factors 
- "How does it help to make troubles heavier by bemoaning them" Seneca 

- The future is unpredictable, prepare without worry 
- Let not future troubles you, for you will have the same reason 


The present moment is all we have, no one can lose the past or the future, for how can one lose something that's not theirs? 

Then the longest and the shortest life are the same, for you can only lose the present moment
