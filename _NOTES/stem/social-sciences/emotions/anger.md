- What is bothering me? Is it the situation or my interpretation of it? 
- Does it really matter?
- What is the underlying reason? 
- Any other emotion under my anger? 
- Am I in charge when angry or calm? 
- Why take it too seriously?
- Is it personal? Even so? 


Anger is the collision of hope and reality

sad AND unexpected -> anger

Expect less, stay calmer
