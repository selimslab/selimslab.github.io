This is a social problem

The Earth is the only home we have in a cold, dark, indifferent space

And we can't help burning it

We need to produce clean energy, consume less, and protect nature

Habitats heal when protected, Barack Obama's "Our Great National Parks" is full of examples 

May oceans, forests, mountains, and every living being be safe from our harm and greed
