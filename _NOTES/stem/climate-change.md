This is a social problem

The Earth is the only home in the cold and dark space and we are burning her 

We need to use clean energy, consume less, and protect oceans, forests, mountains, and the life on earth 

Nature heals when protected 

Political power and economic pressures can overcome the greed, inertia, and short-term focus of states and corporations

We can teach our children, hold our politicians accountable, and stand for the planet 

No effort is too small, every little action sets an example and inspires more people
