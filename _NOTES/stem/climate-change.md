This is a social problem

The Earth is the only home we have in a cold, dark, indifferent space

And we can't help burning it

We need to produce clean energy, consume less, and protect oceans, forests, mountains, and the life on earth 

Habitats heal when protected, Barack Obama's "Our Great National Parks" is full of examples 

Political [[power]] and economic pressures can overcome the greed, inertia, and short-term focus of states and corporations

We can teach our children, hold our politicians accountable, and stand for the planet 

No effort is too small, every little action sets an example and inspires more people
