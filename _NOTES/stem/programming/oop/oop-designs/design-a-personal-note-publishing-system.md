## Goals 

As a user, I would like to

- take markdown notes, with images, links, code, ..
- easily publish 
- can view notes by directory and by tag 
- display backlinks 
- have a simple search 
- have dark mode 
- easily find any note 
- optimize for reading comfort 
- easily personalize 

easily means quick, intuitive, low-effort

my notes are under directories 

they can connect to each other with links or tags 

everything is a file, 

each file has a unique id, typically-like-this 

a tag is also a file, when visited it shows all connected files, 

a tag has a short form and an id, dist: distributed-systems

leverage jekyll variables 

each file can connect but tags and dir files becomes central 

so the index page is entry point 

central files are top level files 

maybe 

make each dir a tag too, and add to page tags 

if a file has path a/b/c connect it to a and b 

should stay stable if the files change location, so urls only have file-ids
