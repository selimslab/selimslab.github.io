Balancing a tree ensures optimal performance for operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching. An unbalanced tree can degrade to a linked list, leading to worst-case time complexities for these operations. Balanced trees maintain logarithmic height, which guarantees efficient performance by keeping operations close to logarithmic time complexity. This improves both search speed and insertion/deletion efficiency.
