Breath easily 

Stay mindful of the voice, tone, and style

Words are irreversible

Think twice before you speak

Be careful with promises

---

Emotions drive the conversation 

Have a positive, constructive attitude. 

Don't try to prove anything, people believe what they want to believe 

Say something good or say nothing.

---

People canâ€™t read minds, explain yourself 

Something being obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to them
