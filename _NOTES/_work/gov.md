raw data size 
let's say there's 100m people. their basic info like names, id numbers etc could take a few kbs. if you add a few photos, and other info about health, legal, education, property ownership, companies, tax, debts, biometrics, etc. it would be at least 10mb per person. 100m * 10 mb is 1 petabyte

there would be another 9pb for the details of all the infra 

10pb for the basic operation of a country with a 100m people, that would be $10m storage cost per year
