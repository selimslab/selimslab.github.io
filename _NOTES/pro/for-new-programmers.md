## Fundamentals 

### 1. Have a high-level overview of the field 

[Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) is fantastic 

or 

[CS50](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW) is Harvard University's introduction to computer science and the art of programming

### 2. Get started with a language

C is a good start

or Python [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) 

or Golang [a tour of go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) [go by example](https://gobyexample.com/)

### 3. Learn terminal basics 

Operating systems have some high-level useful commands 

for example linux and mac have ls, cd, mkdir, mv, touch, rm, cat, sort, uniq, grep

### 4. Meet version control 

Read a bit about git and basic pull request workflow. 

-> git clone, add, commit, push, pull request, merge 

### 5. Meet algorithms 

[Grokking algorithms](http://93.174.95.29/main/9F2B390517083CF4485BA524B80815F5) is visual and fun, a great algorithms book
