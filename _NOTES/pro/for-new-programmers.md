Software should be easy to understand, easy to explain. 

Like in the great Lynyrd Skynyrd song "Simple Man", something you love and understand. 

It takes years to master a craft, but you can start simply by learning one language well. Focus on the fundamentals - variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions. Build small programs to solve simple problems. Break large problems into smaller pieces. Ask questions. 

[Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) and [Harvard CS50](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW) are excellent free introductions to computer science concepts.

Programs organize information, we represent the real world by writing, and it's the same principles of Sumers and Hitits writing their crops and animals on clay tablets 5000 years ago. 

A program is about information, and we call a piece of information "data". Data structures are the fundamental blocks of programs. Like lists, key-value pairs, stacks, queues, trees, .. 

When you choose the right data structure for the problem, algorithms naturally flow from there.

And we need some way to store data. The simplest thing would be to write to keep it in memory. Since a program already works with the data in memory. And if the data is in the long-term like a disk, the program first need to move it from the disk to memory to work with it. However, when the program exits or gets killed or the computer crashes, and it means all prgrams are killed, then the data in program memory is lost. So we use disks to store the data.

C is a good first language to learn as it teaches you about memory management and how computers work at a low level. 

Python or Ruby are dynamic languages, readable and practical [codecademy python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) 

Go is a great intro to statically typed languages, its simplicity is a breath of fresh air after the complexity of Java and C++

JavaScript can also be fun and useful but may not be a good first language as it lacks structure and can encourage bad habits. 

Using basic terminal commands is both useful and a lot of fun, like **ls** to list files and directories, **cd** to change directory, **mkdir** to make a new directory, **touch** to create an empty file, **rm** to remove files and directories, **cat** to output the contents of a file, **sort** to sort, **uniq** to filter unique lines, **grep** to search for patterns in text, .. 

Version control with Git is important to track changes to code. Basic workflow involves git clone to download a repository, git add to stage files for commit, git commit to save changes locally with a message, git push to upload commits to a remote repository like hosted on github for example.
