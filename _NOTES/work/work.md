# QA 

historical context 

Present challenges and opportunities 

Future vision and direction 

---

best things 

would change 


# FEEDBACK 

## fb: error codes 

approach it as tech discussion of numbers vs names as enum keys rather than criticism 

we decided to change the approach 

## fb: distractions after a manager change

shields vs funnels talk with my manager 

haven't solved but helped 


# DIFFICULT SITUATIONS 

## dif: minio overeng 

suggested a session to address their concerns 

led to improvements about deployment and monitoring processes 

## dif: nm, focus on one vs many 

delegated but not really worked 

## dif: pushback against a deadline 

a major release in 3 months and CTO meeting, shift resources 

having new people are great in the long term but won't help with releasing earlier in the short term 

he already knew this but such feedback from the team helped to clarify expectations 

## dif: yachtworld 




# COLLABORATION 

## guided an unhappy teammate in a chaotic period 

provided direction with suggestions for things we can improve, pair programming

he turned out to be one of the most effective people in the team 

## onboarding 3 junior engs 

created onboarding docs 

creating helpful starting tasks

pair programming 

## no data engs 

cover but advocate 

## doodle jump 

overcomplicated trajectory 

process the main character image 





# FEEDBACK 

## fb: improve visibility 

visibility and performance reviews, you need to be comfortable with taking credit where its due 

## fb: try to be more vocal in meetings 

I like to listen more and only speak when I feel is necessary 

I started to practice thinking more out loud and realized many things may not be as obvious as they seem 

results in more engaging meetings 


## fb: keep up the good quality

## fb: keep up the autonomy and empower the team 

## fb: improve inter-team collaboration 



# TECH 

## tech: slow gitlab 

measure & debug 

replace with gitea 

## tech: driven monitoring work 

little structure, no telemetry

DevOps collab 

better monitoring 

## tech: entropy 

Manual decision tree -> bayes -> NLP 

## tech: prototyping an orchestrator

started in memory then moved to redis then to postgres for prod 

resulted in iterating quickly and understanding the problem better before settling 

## tech: Slow builds 

measure, rewrite docker files, parallelize tests, iterate 

## fail: built the wrong yachtworld

should really understood the problem before trying to solve anything

---

Lack of docs -> autodocs 

Reinvented wheels + pivot -> gradually replace 

No data engineers -> cover and advocate 


---

Chaotic onboarding -> write, enrich 



## 

stories are about people 

so if I think of people I worked with, I can come up with some interesting cases, and the stories don't have to be extraordinary
