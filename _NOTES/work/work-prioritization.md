It's possible to classify work items in many ways but I find the approach of security community elegant. The level names are explicit and meaningful compared to assigning numbers. 

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) has four levels 

- Critical
- High
- Medium
- Low 

CVSS has also a score range 0-10, 

- Critical 9-10
- High 7-9
- Medium 4-7
- Low  0-4 

Levels cover 4-3-2-1 point ranges, which makes the top 10% critical part
