planned Senior project poorly and did most of the work on the last week

overall, I overloaded myself and caused a lot of unnecessary stress, feel lucky to not get severe burnout 


## context 

real estate analytics for an alumni 

yacht market analytics 

cosmetics analytics 

retail analytics, supermarket products 

- Crawl  
- Set up a data pipeline
- Implement the business logic 
- Sync to ElasticSearch and Metabase  
- Create an API 
- Create an orchestrator 
- Set up monitoring 
- Create recovery procedure 
- Security review 

entropy, manual decision tree > stats > NLP 

then tried to create a generic system for all this, but it's harder than it sounds, also given my overall experience at the time 
  

- negotiation and pricing mistakes
- underestimating the cost to me and the benefit to the customer 
- clarification mistakes, 
- should only put enough effort to verify an approach 
- distractions of a small business, accounting, office space, bills, contracts, ... 

---

- slow reporting, measure & debug, found the gitlab was the bottleneck, replaced with gitea 

- fb: manager change, guidance through identifying and prioritizing, charting the technical roadmap and communicating through both sessions and docs 

- driven monitoring, log collection, telemetry, DevOps collab 

- error codes feedback 

- inter-team collaboration feedback 
- visibility/communication feedback 


## DP 



### problems 
- minio overeng story 
- redis debug story 
- reinventing dbt  
- duct tape 
- a custom system, hard for data engs  
- slow builds, rewrite dockerfile, remove deps, parallelize tests and CI steps 

- reverse engineered and diagrammed 
- driven the discussion and planning, even discussed with the director and the CTO 
- laid out the problems and our possible actions with their tradeoffs 
- created an MVP and iterated it to feature parity and beyond 
- simple to complex, standard library vs an orchestrator dependency, redis to postgres 
- then led people to integrate it to other systems 
- got 4 swes and 3 data engineers up to speed 
- and had the happiness to see it flourishing

- new airo, adding people won't help with deadlines 
- onboarded juniors, no prisma orm, plain postgres
- dependency script 

## blackops 

concept to production in 6 weeks 
manual entry bug 
initialization bug 
currency conversion bug, 10x the size, exposing us to more risk 
5-7 concurrent traders, $20k, $1m trades per day 

## MS

MS onboarding
volunteered for accessibility
quickly joined on call for a complex system with 2 stacks and  > 5 teams

## WIP 


# FEEDBACK 

## fb: error codes 

approach it as tech discussion of numbers vs names as enum keys rather than criticism 

we decided to change the approach 

## fb: distractions after a manager change

shields vs funnels talk with my manager 

haven't solved but helped 


# DIFFICULT SITUATIONS 

## dif: minio overeng 

suggested a session to address their concerns 

led to improvements about deployment and monitoring processes 

## dif: nm, focus on one vs many 

delegated but not really worked 

## dif: pushback against a deadline 

a major release in 3 months and CTO meeting, shift resources 

having new people are great in the long term but won't help with releasing earlier in the short term 

he already knew this but such feedback from the team helped to clarify expectations 




# COLLABORATION 

## guided an unhappy teammate in a chaotic period 

provided direction with suggestions for things we can improve, pair programming

he turned out to be one of the most effective people in the team 

## onboarding 3 junior engs 

created onboarding docs 

creating helpful starting tasks

pair programming 

## no data engs 

cover but advocate 

## doodle jump 

overcomplicated trajectory 

process the main character image 


# TECH 

## tech: slow gitlab 



## tech: driven monitoring work 

little structure, no telemetry



better monitoring 


## 

stories are about people 

so if I think of people I worked with, I can come up with some interesting cases, and the stories don't have to be extraordinary
