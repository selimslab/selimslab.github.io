<h1>A good life</h1>



<p>Some things are in our control and others not</p>

<p>Do what you can, now and here</p>

<p>Don’t worry for the rest</p>

<hr />

<p>Do not regret mistakes,</p>

<p>You need a lot of mistakes for a few good moves,</p>

<p>a lot bad ideas for a few good ideas.</p>

<hr />

<p>Character is worth the whole world</p>

<p>Our actions and thoughts shape us slowly,</p>

<p>Building a good character takes time and practice</p>

<hr />

<p>Do nothing against your will,</p>

<p>nor against community,</p>

<p>nor without due examination,</p>

<p>nor with reluctancy</p>

<hr />

<p>Do what you feel in your heart to be right,</p>

<p>not what is easy nor what is popular.</p>

<hr />

<p>Don’t give in without a fight</p>

<hr />

<p>There comes a time when one must take a position</p>

<p>that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular,</p>

<p>but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.</p>

<p>― Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

<hr />

<p>You are your best friend</p>

<p>Love you, accept you, believe in you</p>

<hr />

<p>Are you still young and dumb enough to know everything?</p>

<hr />

<p>“Begin at the beginning,” the King said, very gravely,</p>

<p>“and go on till you come to the end: then stop.</p>

<hr />

<p>Golden mean</p>

<hr />

<p>Words are irreversible</p>

<p>Think twice before you speak</p>

<p>Be careful with promises</p>

<hr />

<p>Environment matters</p>

<p>Beauty and ugliness are contagious</p>

<hr />

<p>Treat people with kindness and respect,</p>

<p>even when they don’t deserve it,</p>

<p>out of self-respect and principle</p>

<hr />

<p>There are many ways to interpret reality</p>

<hr />

<p>We deal out judgment to others and seek understanding for ourselves</p>

<p>No one is completely foolish, and we are all foolish in some regards.</p>

<p>Before dismissing a person or judging too harshly, remember we are all human</p>

<hr />

<p>Each of us has the ability to heal</p>

<hr />

<p>A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night,</p>

<p>and in between he does what he wants to do.</p>

<p>Bob Dylan</p>

<hr />

<p>“To leave the world a bit better</p>

<p>whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition;</p>

<p>to know that one life has breathed easier because you lived here.</p>

<p>This is to have succeeded.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Freedom is to conquer your dark side, your anger, greed, pride, ..</p>

<hr />

<p>You are a big as what makes you angry</p>

<p>A stone can disturb a pond but can’t disturb the sea</p>

<p>Feel vast and deep like the ocean, nothing can harm you</p>

<hr />

<p>A good life is to have time for yourself and your loved ones, to be your master</p>

<hr />

<p>Everything can be taken from a man but one thing, the last of the human freedoms,</p>

<p>to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances,</p>

<p>to choose one’s own way.</p>

<p>Viktor E. Frankl</p>

<hr />

<p>Worrying doesn’t make it one bit better, use your energy to act instead</p>

<hr />

<p>Assume the worst, expect everything</p>

<p>There might be no tomorrow morning for you</p>

<hr />

<p>Above all, don’t lie to yourself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Happiness from an experience lasts longer.</p>

<p>Material things have the worst kind of hedonic adaptation.</p>

<p>They come through great toil, and kept by great anxiety.</p>

<hr />

<p>Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben.</p>

<p>What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.</p>

<hr />

<p>Life is not short but we waste it.</p>

<p>“Think of yourself as dead. Now take what’s left, and live it properly.”</p>

<hr />

<p>The whole wisdom and beauty of the world is here to be explored,</p>

<p>and to expand your life beyond your time.</p>

<hr />

<p>The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it - Henry David Thoreau</p>

<hr />

<p>Remove all nonessentials.</p>

<p>Talk less, do less, think less.</p>

<p>Recharge</p>

<hr />

<p>Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished</p>

<hr />

<p>“Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking”</p>
