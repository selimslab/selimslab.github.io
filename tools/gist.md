  - Observe your resentment and dark fantasies 
  - Integrate aggressive impulses into character
  - Speaking up when feeling oppressed prevents toxicity
- Persona = mask we wear to appear harmless
- True morality = capacity for darkness + choosing restraint
- Shadow integration leads to balanced development (aggressive + compassionate qualities)
- "Genuine moral effort was a good substitute for psychotherapy" - Jung

Four dark personality types compared:

- Sociopaths: Antisocial personality disorder with weak conscience and empathy. Hot-tempered, unpredictable, justify wrongdoing. Often stems from harsh family dynamics.

- Psychopaths: Antisocial personality disorder with zero empathy. Appear normal while concealing true nature. Traits stem from brain chemistry. Lack normal restraints against violence.

- Narcissists: Extreme self-importance and entitlement. View others as tools. Seek emotional reactions, control, character traits to steal, and advantages. Develops from childhood trauma.

- Dark Empaths: Newer concept (2021) combining high empathy scores with dark triad traits. Possess cognitive empathy without emotional empathy, making manipulations particularly effective.

Psychopaths and dark empaths considered most harmful, with dark empaths possibly being most dangerous due to their intuitive understanding of others' feelings.
