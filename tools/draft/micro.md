# Evolution of Microservices Architecture

## Monolith to Microservices
- Started with monoliths: one large application with all business logic
- Problems: complex maintenance, slow releases, tight team coordination
- Solution: break into self-contained microservices units owned by teams
- Initial benefits: independent evolution, faster deployment, more agility

## Problems with Early Microservices
- Synchronous REST API communication created tight coupling
- Exposing too many microservices directly to customers made evolution difficult
- Unclear responsibility boundaries between services
- Duplicated infrastructure solutions across teams
- Hard to coordinate changes across services
- Difficult to introduce new shared services
- HTTP/JSON communication proved inefficient at scale

## Patterns for Better Microservices

### API Gateway Pattern
- Clients only know about API gateway, not individual services
- Benefits: centralized authentication, routing, rate limiting, logging, analytics
- Risk: API gateway becoming a new monolith bottleneck

### Service Mesh with Sidecars
- Distributed internal API gateway for east-west traffic
- Sidecars: language-agnostic proxies deployed next to each service
- Functions: service discovery, routing, rate limiting, logging
- Benefits: reduced overhead, centralized functionality without bottlenecks

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Services communicate by publishing events (facts about the world)
- Benefits:
  - Service independence - can operate despite other service failures
  - Local state management - services keep relevant data locally
  - Easier to add new services without coordination
  - Asynchronous processing - handles traffic spikes better

### Schema Management
- Events schemas become the new API contracts
- Need validation to prevent breaking changes
- Schema registries help enforce compatibility

### Serverless Evolution
- Running microservices as functions without managing infrastructure
- Challenge: maintaining state in stateless functions
- Future: durable functions with state management capabilities
