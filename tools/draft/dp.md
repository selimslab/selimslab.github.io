# Observability and Monitoring for Data Pipelines

## Data Pipelines Overview
- ETL process: Extract data from source, Transform data, Load into warehouse/storage
- Types: Batch processes (periodic, chunky) and streaming processes (continuous, high throughput)
- Common orchestration tools: Luigi, Airflow, AWS Data Pipeline, Google Dataflow

## Common Issues
- Batch jobs: Not scheduled/run, unexpected duration, data corruption/loss
- Streaming: Queue backup, data loss, stream delays
- Non-deterministic systems (ML models): Unpredictable behavior

## Monitoring Strategies
- Batch jobs: Monitor run duration, batch size, memory usage
- Streaming: Measure latency, egress/ingress rates, age of oldest unprocessed data
- General concerns: Delayed processing, data integrity issues

## Key Concepts
- Interpretability: Understanding why models predict as they do (fairness, privacy, reliability)
- Observability: Building systems easy to debug when encountering unknown issues

## Pipeline Design Features
1. Immutable data
   - Core for testing, idempotent operations, reproducibility
   - Store data as sequence of events rather than current state
2. Data lineage
   - Track data through pipeline stages
   - Tag records with metadata, use distributed tracers
3. Test run capability
   - Validate assumptions before production deployment
   - Gradual validation to build domain expertise

## Testing, Monitoring, Alerting
- Testing pyramid: Unit tests, service tests, UI tests
- Additional for data pipelines: Regression tests, champion-challenger models
- Monitoring: Check job success, verify input/output relationships, track latency
- Tools: Prometheus (metrics), Grafana (visualization)
- Set alerting thresholds based on established baselines
