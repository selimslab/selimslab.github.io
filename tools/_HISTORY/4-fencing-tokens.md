# Fencing Tokens

## What They Are
Fencing tokens are **monotonically increasing numbers** issued by a lock service each time it grants a lease or lock to a client. Each new lock gets a higher number than the previous one.

## The Problem They Solve
Without fencing tokens, you get the **split-brain problem** illustrated in the chapter:

1. Client 1 gets a lease with 30-second timeout
2. Client 1 pauses (GC, network issue, etc.) for 40 seconds  
3. Lock service grants lease to Client 2 (Client 1's lease expired)
4. Client 1 wakes up, still thinks it has the lease
5. **Both clients now think they own the resource** â†’ data corruption

## How Fencing Tokens Work

```
1. Client 1 gets lease + token 33
2. Client 1 pauses (lease expires)
3. Client 2 gets lease + token 34  
4. Client 2 writes to storage with token 34
5. Client 1 wakes up, tries to write with token 33
6. Storage service rejects Client 1 (token 33 < 34)
```

## Key Requirements

### Lock Service
- Issues incrementing tokens (33, 34, 35...)
- Never reuses or decreases token numbers

### Protected Resource (Storage/Database)
- **Must actively check tokens** - this is critical
- Remembers highest token seen
- Rejects requests with older tokens
- Cannot rely on clients to self-police

## Real-World Examples
- **ZooKeeper**: Uses `zxid` (transaction ID) or `cversion` (node version) as fencing tokens
- **File systems**: Include token in filename if service doesn't support tokens natively

## Why It Works
- **Prevents zombie clients**: Old lease holders can't cause damage after waking up
- **Ordering guarantee**: Ensures operations happen in lock-grant order
- **Server-side protection**: Doesn't trust clients to behave correctly

Fencing tokens are essential for building **safe distributed locks** that prevent data corruption from process pauses and network partitions.
