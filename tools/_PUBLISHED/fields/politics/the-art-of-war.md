The point is winning without fighting

Know yourself, know the enemy, win with ease

-

First eliminate the risk of defeat, than look for victory 

Recklessness, cowardice, haste, pride, mercy leads to defeat

-

To secure ourselves is in our hands. 

Enemy provides the opportunity to be defeated. 

-


Know when to fight and when not to fight. 

Plan before the battle, count the cost if you wish to fight 

Haste is stupid but long delays are not clever either

-

Evade stronger enemy

If the enemy is united, separate them 

Don't make your enemy desperate, leave an outlet 

Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.


## Warfare is deception 

Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.

if you can attack, seem unable 

seem inactive if you are active 

seem far when near, near when far 

-

Pretend to be weak so they grow arrogant 

Irritate the enemy, make them angry

If you can't control your anger, you lose 

-

Attack unexpectedly. Be prepared and wait to take them unprepared
