## Bias-variance

high bias: misses patterns, underfitting. eg. linear regression: high bias, low variance

high-variance: fits to noise, overfitting. eg. decision tree: low bias, high variance

## accurate vs interpretable
black box models can be more accurate but not interpretable 

## complexity vs generality 
complex models might fit well but may fail to generalize to new data 

simpler models generalize better 


## precision vs recall
precise has few false positives but misses some true ones 

high recall: more true positives but also more false ones 

1-score: harmonic mean of both 

eg. spam detection - balance of catching more spam without marking good emails as spam
