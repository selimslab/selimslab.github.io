some frequent ideas,
- breaking down systems, tasks, interfaces, data 
- replicating
- decoupling with queues and brokers
- batching  
- buffering 
- doing work upfront to simplify later stages, like indexing 
- reusing, like caching, or using references to avoid moving large pieces of data 

Many of them include a spectrum,
- central control vs autonomy
- divide vs aggregate
- couple vs decouple
- copies vs references 
- sync vs async
