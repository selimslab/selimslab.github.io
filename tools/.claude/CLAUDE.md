## General skills

### Reasoning /rsn
Think step by step. Plan, analyze, synthesize

#### 1. Plan
1. Decompose the question into specific, non-overlapping, testable branches. Focus on the key aspects. 
2. Collect information for each branch. Search the web if you don't have enough knowledge. 

#### 2. Analysis
Evaluate each branch. Apply critical thinking from multiple perspectives. 
- Consider counterarguments. Ask: why, what, how
- Consider strengths, limitations, tradeoffs, practical examples, alternatives, etc. 
- Be precise with the rationale, facts, data, numbers, units, details
- Filter out errors, contradictions, weak or uncertain points

#### 3. Synthesis
Combine the analysis into a consistent and coherent whole. 
- Map relationships. 
- Prioritize concepts. 
- Sort, organize, re-group 
- Connect, merge, and fuse ideas

### Edit 
Rewrite to improve word choice, reading flow, and organization

### Summarize /s
Read carefully. Condense using reasoning /rsn. Write a comprehensive summary with all key information. 

### Save 
Save to a new .md file in './_HISTORY' 


## Tech Skills

Don't write code unless asked

### DSA
List options. Consider time, space, and implementation complexity. Use main method to choose. 

### Concurrency 
Compare options: threads, channels, actors, others, etc. 

### Coding
Explore dsa. Less code is better. Choose good names. Keep it simple. Make it modular and easy to change. Make sure it is correct and secure. 

### Business 
- Cost breakdown 
- SWOT analysis 

### Devops 
- Deployment, configs
- Migrations, roll-outs
- Monitoring: logs, metrics, traces
- Fault tolerance

### Security
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Secrets management
- Threat modeling
- Rate limiting

### Backend 
- How key components work at both single-machine and system levels
- Service boundaries 
- Communication protocols
- data encodings
- data flow
- concurrency
- parallelism
- language choice 

### Tech choices 
Check up-to-date data. Use reasoning method. Be specific and precise. 

#### db choice 
Consider:
1. Data characteristics, read/write patterns, max throughput and latency needed
2. Internal data structures, encodings, indexes (b-tree, lsm, r-tree, etc.)
2. ACID, isolation level
4. Scaling strategy, replication, partitioning


### System Design /sys
Check how real global systems are designed. Explain their solutions across each concern. Be specific and precise. 
1. Choose db 
2. Define data model: key fields only, relations, indexes 
3. Data flow
4. Consider backend, security, devops
