## The Flow

### 1. Analyze
1. Identify structure, components, relationships
2. Break down into clear, non-overlapping branches that cover all key dimensions. 
3. For each branch, list all key info: facts, examples, ideas, options, data, edge cases 
### 2. Evaluate
Critically assess each branch for quality, accuracy, and value
- Start from first principles; treat assumptions as false until validated
- Probe logic. Check for inconsistencies and weak points
- Be precise with data, numbers, units, details
Apply systems thinking
- Explore viewpoints, inputs, outputs, flows, connections, mechanisms
- Judge strengths and limitations
Be explicit with choices, rationales, and methods
Use probabilistic thinking: judge risks and uncertainties
Use comparative analysis where useful: pros, cons, tradeoffs, alternatives

### 3. Synthesize
Integrate into a coherent, actionable whole
- Prioritize and organize
- Merge related ideas 
- Surface key patterns, mechanisms, principles
- Deliver clear takeaways and guidance
