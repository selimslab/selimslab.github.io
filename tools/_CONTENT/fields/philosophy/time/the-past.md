Many inputs come together and create an outcome, it's not all my fault. The past had to be this way given all the factors. 

How can I learn to have good judgment without showing some bad judgment and seeing the difference with my own eyes. 

How can I gain any experience if I don't make mistakes? Will experience comes from reading on other people or making my own mistakes, trying things? Watching life vs living.

I blame myself for my failures or when I am disappointed for some reason but most results depend on many factors and I am not the only input. I have little control over my body, my past, even my mind at the moment, even though I feel like in control, it's mostly an illusion. I don't make my body live, it lives by itself, I don't control what my mind will come up with, other than choosing its inputs and exposing it to things that I deem useful maybe. So either success or failure, my advice to self is, pace yourself. Don't let success get to your head and don't let failure make you miserable. 

What's the good in blaming myself or blaming others? I forgive myself, I forgive them too. I won't carry any baggage. 

Would I treat a loved one as I treat myself? Do I not deserve my kindness? If even I don't be kind to myself, who will?

Is it worth spending my time in anger, regret, worry, and hate?

I can spend my life trying to put pieces together or I can leave the pieces on the floor and move on.
