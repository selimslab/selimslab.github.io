"May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out"

This too shall pass. The morning will come, the spring will come. There'll be soft rains. 

Yes it's painful, do I magnify the pain even further in my mind? Walk no more in shadows 

It's how I carry it 

Can I face it? Do  I face it? 

Can I choose my own way, my attitude? Can I come out better on the other side? 

Can I get up and do something? 

Courage is found in unlikely places

Don't be unhappy before the crisis comes.
