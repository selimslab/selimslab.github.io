Feelings come from thoughts, not external sources

We need to be seen, heard, loved, accepted, respected. 

Emotions are like signals. Green lights, red lights. 

How I feel is like weather, I may not change it but I can choose my own actions 

"Its braver to overcome desire than to conquer enemy, for the hardest victory is over self" Aristotle 

## Anger 

There's often some surprise under the anger. What's surprising here? 

Can I use my energy for something better? Is it worth stressing myself?

It can't disturb me unless I assign it importance 

"Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.”
― Carl Gustav Jung

## Anxiety 

A tiny drop of possible trouble

Look at it, differently

Gratitude

## Arrogance

- Are you not yet another living being?
- Do you have to prove something?
- Do you need to pretend to be more than you are?
- Why show contempt instead of being happy with using your good qualities?


## Courage 

Doing what is right even if you are afraid 

## Ego 

Most things are not personal, not about you  

I make mistakes and that's ok 

## Empathy 

We deal out judgment to others and seek understanding for ourselves

Social skills naturally arise from genuine empathy

## Loneliness

"The lonely one offers his hand too quickly to whomever he encounters" Nietzsche 

## Love 

"Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new.”

## Happiness

> Very little is needed to make a happy life;  
> it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking  

"Something to do, someone to love, something to hope for.”

"Happiness always looks small while you hold it in your hands, but let it go, and you learn at once how big and precious it is." _Maxim Gorky_


## Hope 

"It won't be as good as you hope, neither as bad as you fear"

"Hope itself is often better than what you are hoping for"

"False hopes are more dangerous than fears."

"A ship shouldn't ride on a single anchor nor life on a single hope" Epictetus


## Trust 

Trust is the most delicate thing. Be impeccable with your word.

People will never forget how you made them feel.

"In other words, the default state is to trust, and what the amygdala does is learn vigilance and distrust.”


## Vulnerability

"Conceal a flaw and the world will imagine the worst"
