You auth by either something you know, you have, or you are, eg. password, a phone, face 

Some good practices
- Use 2-factor auth
- Add exponential delay to repeated login attempts
- Lock account after repeated failed login attempts
- Use authorization levels
- Apply least privilege principle - never grant more access than required
- Implement separation of privileges - avoid all-or-nothing system access
- Use allow-lists instead of block-lists
