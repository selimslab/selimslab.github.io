thank you for joining me on a rainy
day nothing new there um so I am in the
conservatory and I want to share a piece
with you that is written by a lady
called Cassie
Phillips um I came across it on Facebook
somebody had shared
it and it's one of those pieces that
I've read reread
and read
again and it really strikes home for
me so I will share it and
then add my thoughts in at the
end so it's called let
them just let
them if they want to choose something or
someone over
you let
them if they want to go weeks without
talking to
you let them if they're okay with never
seeing you let them if they are okay
with always putting themselves
first let them if they are showing you
who they are and not what you perceived
them to be let
them if they want to follow the crowd
let
them if they want to judge or
misunderstand
you let them if they act like they can
live without
you let
them if they want to walk out of your
life and
leave hold the door open and let
them let them lose you you are never
there say because you were always your
own so let them let them show you who
they truly
are not tell
you let them prove how worthy they are
of your
time let them make the necessary steps
to be a part of your
life let them earn your for
forgiveness let them call you to talk
about ordinary
things let them take you out on the
Thursday let them talk about anything
and
everything just because it's you they
are talking
to let them have a safe place in
you let them see the heart in you that
didn't
Hardon let them love
you okay so as I say that has affected
me on a very personal
level pause for a deep intake of
breath and I knew it would affect me
reading it out loud so I've actually
jotted down my ideas beforehand
you have to accept
yourself just as you are without having
to make changes for
others if you feel that you have to
change to maintain a
relationship if that change is always
one-sided then the relationship might
need to be G given some
consideration and do
not not Auto automatically take the
blame and punish yourself for any of the
things that they have
done um yeah some of us find that hard
to
do and on occasion you might be tempted
to heal a
riff but they have to earn a place back
in your life otherwise it will be very
quickly back to as was same
old you need to be shown respect and
that your
needs your
wishes
you are
considered they don't value you and you
deserve to be
valued and to be made to feel
valued let's face it it's form of
control don't let them control
you you are the only one who has control
of
you unless you give that control
away never forget
that you belong to
nobody but
yourself so establish those
boundaries establishing them is one
thing
keeping them is
another have a big conversation with
yourself about where those
boundaries need to
be
and if there would be any
opportunity that you might feel you
would allow those boundaries to
fall but put
yourself your considerations top of the
a
pile that's not
selfish it really isn't though many
people think it
is it's
self-caring self-
nurturing and boy if those others aren't
doing
it you must you really
must on that note I will say thank you
very much for joining
me and
take care take care of you no matter
what the world no matter what other
people be
they can inverted come as friends or
family work
colleagues
whatever think of
you thank you for joining me bye for now
bye
