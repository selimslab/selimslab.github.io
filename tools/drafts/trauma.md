# Trauma and Its Impact: Bessel van der Kolk's Perspective

- Trauma is ubiquitous in society; even seemingly "normal" families contain trauma
- Bessel van der Kolk: psychiatrist, neuroscientist studying trauma for 50 years, author of "The Body Keeps the Score"
- Initially studied Vietnam veterans in 1978 who were disconnected from present, emotionally dysregulated
- Definition of PTSD: body continues to re-experience traumatic events through images, behaviors, physical sensations
- Trauma prevalence: 1/5 women sexually molested, 1/4 children beaten by parents, 1/8 witness parental violence

## Trauma Mechanisms
- Traumatic experiences enter through senses into primitive brain areas that assess danger
- Events become traumatic when escape is impossible, triggering fight/flight or collapse
- Long-term effect: continued reactions to mild stressors as life-threatening
- Most people unaware their current reactions stem from past experiences

## Treatment Approaches
- Traditional mental health often dismisses life realities (poverty, racism, unemployment)
- Conventional approach focuses on "fixing" with drugs or cognitive behavioral therapy
- Effective treatment requires:
  - Supportive relationships
  - Being heard
  - Processing feelings, guilt
  - Understanding origins of reactions
  - Self-compassion
  - Recognizing reactions as rooted in past experiences

## Legacy Goal
- Society understanding trauma's impacts
- Creating necessary conditions for trauma survivors to develop healthy brains/minds
- Enabling full societal participation for those who experienced adverse conditions

# Healing the Inner Child

  - Shaming, criticizing, blaming, guilting
  - Teasing, belittling emotions, manipulation, betrayal
  - Invalidating feelings, enmeshment, conditional love

## Effects on Development
- Development of false/inauthentic self to stay safe
- Relationships characterized by: envy, criticism, perfectionism, conformity
- Suppression of feelings or passive-aggressive expression
- Overdeveloped parent script, pretending to be strong
- Distrusting others, controlling behavior or withdrawal
- Emotional regulation difficulties with polarized thinking
- Development often stuck at age of trauma

- Need for control, inability to trust
- Over-responsibility, perfectionism
