comm

have goals, what do i want to convey? what message, what emotion 

did you say that to hurt me?

unravelling a knot together 

solving a murder together 

navigating a crisis together 

words dilute 

i can pause anytime 

i can relax, don't have to remember anything

i trust myself

in my own words, in my own voice 

"what did you hear"
