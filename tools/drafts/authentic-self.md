This TED talk by Caroline McHugh explores how to be authentically yourself:

Main idea: Being your authentic self is both the simplest yet most difficult achievement in life, and requires understanding the different dimensions of your identity.

Key points about authenticity:
- We operate best as ourselves at two life stages: as young children (before self-consciousness) and as elderly people (when we stop caring about others' opinions)
- The "middle years" are most challenging for authenticity as we try to accommodate social expectations
- True individuality has no competition - your uniqueness is incomparable to others
- When you discover your authentic self, you become "larger than life" - taking up the full space the universe intended for you

The "I complex" - four dimensions of identity:
- External perception: what others think of you (necessary to understand but dangerous to prioritize)
- Wish image: what you want others to think, representing your potential and growth
- Self-perception: what you think of yourself (fluctuates between extremes)
- Inner self: your unchanging core essence that transcends thoughts, feelings, possessions and relationships

Wisdom for authentic living:
- Develop "interiority" - a non-comparative way of being not dependent on others
- Build a stable relationship with your ego where it serves rather than dominates you
- Cultivate humility ("thinking about yourself less, not thinking less of yourself")
- Understand your life itself is your message to the world
