They will forget your words but not your actions 

The way to raise honest, brave, kind, hardworking, and loving children is to lead by example 

---

They should learn responsibility, how to solve problems, how to manage things on their own 

---

Take them seriously and treat them with respect, 

it makes them feel like grown-ups and they love it

Ignorance isn’t stupidity

Let a child be angry, 

Be patient, do not yell, 

Remember that they are children and you are the adult

Wait a bit before buying something, 

because they don't really want most things. having a 1 month rule is useful.
