title: A good life  
---



Some things are in our control and others not

Do what you can, now and here 

Don't worry for the rest 

---

Do not regret mistakes, 

You need a lot of mistakes for a few good moves, 

a lot bad ideas for a few good ideas. 

---


Character is worth the whole world  

Our actions and thoughts shape us slowly,

Building a good character takes time and practice 

---

Do nothing against your will, 

nor against community, 

nor without due examination, 

nor with reluctancy 

---

Do what you feel in your heart to be right, 

not what is easy nor what is popular. 

---

Don't give in without a fight 

---

There comes a time when one must take a position 

that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, 

but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.

― Martin Luther King Jr.

You are your best friend 

Love you, accept you, believe in you 

---


Are you still young and dumb enough to know everything?

---

"Begin at the beginning," the King said, very gravely, "and go on till you come to the end: then stop.

---

Golden mean

---

Words are irreversible

Think twice before you speak

Be careful with promises

---

Environment matters 

Beauty and ugliness are contagious 

---

Treat people with kindness and respect, even when they don't deserve it, out of self-respect and principle

---

There are many ways to interpret reality 

---


We deal out judgment to others and seek understanding for ourselves

No one is completely foolish, and we are all foolish in some regards. 

Before dismissing a person or judging too harshly, remember we are all human

---

Each of us has the ability to heal 

---

A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do. - Bob Dylan

---

"To leave the world a bit better  

whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; 

to know that one life has breathed easier because you lived here. 

This is to have succeeded."

---

Freedom is to conquer your dark side, your anger, greed, pride, ..

---

You are a big as what makes you angry 

A stone can disturb a pond but can't disturb the sea 

Feel vast and deep like the ocean, nothing can harm you 

---

A good life is to have time for yourself and your loved ones, to be your master

---

Everything can be taken from a man but one thing, the last of the human freedoms, 

to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, 

to choose one’s own way.

Viktor E. Frankl

---

Worrying doesn’t make it one bit better, use your energy to act instead

---

Assume the worst, expect everything

There might be no tomorrow morning for you 

---

Above all, don't lie to yourself. 

---

Happiness from an experience lasts longer. 

Material things have the worst kind of hedonic adaptation. 

They come through great toil, and kept by great anxiety. 

---

Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben. 

What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.

---

Life is not short but we waste it. 

"Think of yourself as dead. Now take what's left, and live it properly."

---

The whole wisdom and beauty of the world is here to be explored,

and to expand your life beyond your time. 

---

The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it - Henry David Thoreau

---

Remove all nonessentials. 

Talk less, do less, think less. 

Recharge

---

Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished

---

"Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking"
