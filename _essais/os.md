title: Logos, a very simple operating system kernel from scratch

Modern life runs on computers, and they run on operating systems 

So how do they really work? What happens under the hood?

Questions follow each other.

This is a project to understand and replicate the great [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) 

Logos bootloads a kernel, connects it to the keyboard and screen, and starts a basic shell

These two books helped me a lot, as well as spending a few hours on [os-dev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page) 


1. Operating Systems: From 0 to 1
2. Writing a Simple Operating System — from Scratch

---

Reading Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces helped me cover more OS concepts, like scheduling, virtualization, file systems, concurrency, .. 


## Containers

Although OS provides process isolation, containers provide more isolation and ease on top of that  

[Containers From Scratch • Liz Rice • GOTO 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc) is a great look under the hood for what really is a container
