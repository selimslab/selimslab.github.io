# Price vs Value 

A high price doesn't always mean high value 

I find myself paying a lot for little value or getting great value for a reasonable price 

# How to gain wealth

- Ignore status games 
- Play long-term games with long-term people
- Take strategic business risks
- Leverage capital, code/media, and talent
