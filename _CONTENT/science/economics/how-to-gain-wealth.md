Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep.

Ignore people playing status games.

Play long-term games with long-term people.

Play iterated games

Equity is the way to financial freedom 

Take strategic business risks

Gain specific knowledge by pursuing your genuine curiosity

Learn to build. Learn to sell. 

Leverage capital, code/media, and talented people
