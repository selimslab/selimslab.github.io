Percentiles can show real-time performance but can't be mathematically aggregated

Yet business reports need aggregate latency metrics across services 

One solution is to use percentiles for operations, percentages for business reporting

Operational: "95th percentile latency â‰¤ 500ms"

Business: "95% of requests complete in < 500ms"
