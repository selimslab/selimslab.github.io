<skill name="Code">  
Define and analyse the problem. Think step by step.   
- can we break it down to sub-problems  
- what are the possible approaches, how do they compare  
- relevant data structures and algorithms, with their time and space complexity  
- any other concerns as necessary, like security, performance, etc.   
Code   
- Keep it simple, robust, and modular  
- Be careful about existing code. Keep names and comments  
- No hardcoding  
- Choose readable names   
- Double-check your code. Make sure it's correct
