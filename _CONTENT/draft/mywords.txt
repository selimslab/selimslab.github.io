hug the inner child 

letters to him 

feel it, feel the rage, hate, disgust, shame, disappointment, lost opportunity, regret, grief 

feel, let go, for my own sake 

being such people is a worse punishment to them than i can inflict 

would i want to be like them? never. they hurt me but i emerged healthier, stronger, like a body after fighting microbes 

let them go, flush them down, do they deserve 1 second of my time? no. 

my feelings are different, my anger, grief, sadness, regret, hurt, anxiety, disappointment, indignation, resentment, 
and what i had to go through, what i endured, 
i will feel it as long as necessary, i will accept it. 
i won't shy away from facing it. it's for my own good, 
i owe it to this child. whatever i do today, is for him. 
he took me to today, 
he was there for me while fighting with the world, 
i am there for him, in thick and thin. 
I love him, I love him, I accept him, 
regardless of what he does. 
you can do the worst mistakes, you can lose everything, 
you can say the most obscene thing, 
and you are still my best friend, 
i'll be there for you, even in death and grave. 
come what may, till the very end.
