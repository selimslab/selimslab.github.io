Work is forgotten, kindness remains

## Cycle
- write, draw, define: the top goal, the next action
- one step to start
- short, focused intervals
- checkpoint, cliffhanger
- rest

## Tactics
- checklists
- batch similar

early morning: fresh mind
night: solve in sleep

## flow
unbox: do I like the process? or just desire the result?
follow my heart
take care of body and mind
stay humble but don't short-sell
know my limits, don't hide flaws

I have less time than I think

## wealth
- long-term games
- strategic risks
- leverage
- does it build any lasting capital? skill, reputation, connection?

## Procrastination
Why do I not want to do it? from heart? mind? hand?
How do I feel? bored, overwhelmed, afraid, distracted?
