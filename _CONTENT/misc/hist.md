## time

The earth is about 4.5 billion years old.

Let's take it to human-scale and say she is 45 years old. Then the known universe is 138 years old. Milky Way is 136 years old

A thousand years is 5 mins, a century is 30 seconds

Trees appeared a 3-4 years ago. Alps and Himalayas formed in the past year.

Dinosaurs appeared two years ago.

Humans evolved last month.
Controlled fire 3 days ago.
Started agriculture an hour ago.
Industrial revolution and world wars happened in the last minute


## climate

Earth was here long before us, it'll be here long after us. Humans are trivial for the planet.

[[soft-rains]]

## agriculture
- Hunter-gatherers had diverse diets and a lot of free time
- They were physically active and fit like olympic athletes
- They had superb survival skills and a deep connection to nature

like free animals vs farm animals
