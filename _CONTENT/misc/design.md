Design = communication

Choose a specific audience

Leverage the constraints 

Ask users about specific problems in the past and their response

Respectful to time and energy 
- Easy to figure out
- Familiar 
- Visible 
- Mindful of emotions
- Sensible responses to mistakes 

Test early and often: five people in a real setting, three times, 

Usage is like oxygen: ship it 

Good ideas are in plain sight. Connect, reorder, timing 

> "What makes something simple or complex? It's not the number of dials or controls or how many features it has: It is whether the person using the device has a good conceptual model of how it operates."

Autoplay

Easy to get in, hard to get out
