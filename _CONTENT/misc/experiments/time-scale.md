The earth is about 4.5 billion years old. 

Let's take it to human-scale and say the Earth is 45 years old. 

100 million years for us feels like a year to her. 

Then the Milky Way is 136 years old, 

and Big Bang happened 138 years ago.

**By the same scale,** 

A decade is 3 seconds

A human lifetime is about 20 seconds

a century, 30 seconds

200 years, a minute

1000 years, 5 minutes 

300 000 years, a day 

**For the 45 years old Mother Earth,**

Dinosaurs appeared 2 years ago and lived for ~1.5 years 

Human species evolved during the last two weeks

Made early stone tools a week ago

Learned to control fire in the last few days 

Agriculture started an hour ago (12 000 years)

Sumer, writing, wheel, 30 minutes ago

Ancient Egypt 25 minutes ago 

Babylonia 20 minutes ago 

Trojan War 16 minutes ago 

Rome was found 14 minutes ago

Renaissance 3 minutes ago 

Industry a minute ago

WW2 25 seconds ago

Each decade is about 3 seconds, in a 138 years old universe
