## Emotions 

Like weather 

Like signals 

It's how I look, eyes don't see, brain sees

Anger: assertion, firm but calm  

Annoyance: curiosity 

Anxiety: hope 

Arrogance: really?

Love should be remade every day, like fresh bread 

Happiness looks small while you hold it in your hands 

Conceal a flaw and the world will imagine the worst

## Kids 

Lead by example

Let a child be angry. Remember that they are children and you are the adult

They love responsibility. Take them seriously and treat them with respect. It makes them feel like grown-ups and they love it. 

If you have a rule, explain the reason.

## Lies 

Ask specific questions, go backwards, change order of events, zoom in and out 

Liers may look down, lower voice, set up a barrier, pepper it with irrelevant details

Jests, mimics, fake smiles, too little or too much eye contact

These are not proof of deception, just signals 


## Procrastination

Not always harmful  

Why do I not want to do it? How do I feel? bored, overwhelmed, afraid, distracted? 


## lines 

Be kind to yourself. If you won't, who will?

Nothing in excess

Be here and now

Much that passes as idealism is disguised hatred or disguised love of power.

We overvalue people we don't know and undervalue those we do

Give your mind some space

Give support, not advice

You can't argue with all the fools in the world

Mistakes of others are easier to notice

You must make a decision that you are going to move on

Success comes from genuine interest

Action is the antidote to despair

You become what you give your attention to

Am I lying to myself?

The measure of intelligence is the ability to change

When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago

Judge less, accept more

It's not personal

Take responsibility of your own happiness, never put it in other people's hands

Exercise is a wonder drug

Each of us can heal

We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be

Environment affects us more than we suspect

The mind can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven

We deal out judgment to others and seek understanding for ourselves

A distracted mind is a weak mind

Hell is truth seen too late

The pain is neither unbearable nor unending, as long as you keep in mind its limits, and don't magnify them in your imagination

Why do you fight with yourself?

Comparison is the thief of joy

Conceal a flaw, and the world will imagine the worst

False hopes are dangerous

Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.

Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.
