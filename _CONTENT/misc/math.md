## logic proofs 

1. P => Q (direct proof)
2. -Q =>-P (proof by contrapositive) 
3. (P ^ -Q) => Q (proof by contradicting the conclusion) 
4. (P ^ -Q) => -P (proof by contradicting the hypothesis) 
5. (P ^ -Q) => (R ^ -R) (proof by reductio ad absurdum)

## Probability 

Normal dist: 99.7% are within three standard deviations of the mean

Hypothesis testing  

Population sampling 

Variables, dependent, independent, control 

quantitative, discrete, continuous 

categorical, binary, ordinal, nominal 

confounding, latent, composite

Descriptive statistics, distribution, central tendency, variability 

Confidence interval 

Statistical significance, p-value 

Inferential statistics 

Central Limit Theorem 

Frequentist vs Bayesian statistics 

Simpson's Paradox: Trends which appear in groups of data may disappear or reverse when the groups are combined.


## Bayes 

Probability of an event changes with new info 

    A - - -

    B     - - - - 

If you know A happened, prob. of B becomes 0.25
