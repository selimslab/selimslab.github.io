## teamwork 

The way to do anything great

We trust surgical teams with our lives because everyone in the team is an expert in their job. 
They trust each other and work together

- Genuine interest
- Clear owners
- Highly trained people, autonomous in their area
- The right person in the right place
- Consistency, clarity, certainty in rewards and consequences

## leadership 

Lead by example 

Remove obstacles 

Only few things are important. 
- Balance data with intuition and experience. 
- Not every important thing is measurable.
- Manage the top line and the bottom line will follow.

What if I believe in people, what if I treat people as what they could be 

## some mistakes 

Insecurity: trying to prove your worth, competing, complaining

Distrust: micromanaging, not delegating

Impatience -> Not listening well -> Not asking the right questions

Being all-business, viewing people as "resources"

Hiring people similar to yourself

Single management style

Decisions are your responsibility. Don't let anyone pressure you
