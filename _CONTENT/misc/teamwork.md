## team-building
- Genuine interest
- Clear owners
- Highly trained people, autonomous in their area
- The right person in the right place
- Consistency, clarity, certainty in rewards and consequences

surgical teams: trust, expertise

## leadership
lead by example
remove obstacles
data vs intuition
important few, top line, bottom line

What if I believe in people, what if I treat people as what they could be

## some mistakes
- Insecurity: trying to prove your worth, competing, complaining
- Distrust: micromanaging, not delegating
- Impatience -> Not listening well -> Not asking the right questions
- Being all-business, viewing people as "resources"
- Hiring people similar to yourself
- Single management style
- Decisions are your responsibility. Don't let anyone pressure you
