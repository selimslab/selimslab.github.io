## time 

The earth is about 4.5 billion years old. Let's take it to human-scale and say she is 45 years old. 

Then the known universe is 138 years old. Milky Way is 136 years old

A thousand years is 5 mins, a century is 30 seconds

Trees appeared a 3-4 years ago. Mountains formed in the past year. 

Dinosaurs appeared two years ago and disappeared this year. 

Humans evolved last month, learned to use fire 3 days ago, started agriculture an hour ago.   

Industrial revolution and world wars happened in the last minute


## climate 

Earth was here long before us, it'll be here long after us. 

Humans are trivial for the planet. If we all went extinct today, there'd be few traces left in a few thousand years, which is like a few minutes to the planet. 

## agriculture

Was agriculture really a step forward for humanity? 
- Hunter-gatherers had diverse diets and a lot of free time  
- They were physically active and fit like olympic athletes
- They had superb survival skills and a deep connection to nature 

Us vs them is like free animals vs farm animals

## culture 

Rice farming takes an entire village: asia solved this with collectivism. Sugar too but us solved it with slavery

## price vs value 
A high price doesn't always mean high value 

I find myself paying a lot for little value or getting great value for a reasonable price 

Then how to value things?
