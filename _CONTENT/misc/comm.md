Am I here now? Am I really listening now? 

Define the target message
- goals, non-goals 
- knowns, unknowns
- Should I say it? in this tone? with these words? 
- Am I promising anything? 
- Can I make it more clear? 
- Do I really mean it? 

Silver arrows: my own words, complete sentences

Golden silence: pause, breath, wait  

Read the room: 
- underlying emotions, motives
- hopes, fears
- open ended questions 

We love to feel seen and heard

It takes two people to speak, if not, just move on
