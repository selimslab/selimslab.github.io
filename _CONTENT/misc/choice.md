What I choose is who I become 

The times and culture affects me yet I still have choice 
- I can make the best of my circumstance 
- Even in prison, illness, and death, I can choose my attitude 

I am a child of nature like trees and stars
- Nature is balancing, I can observe it
- It doesn't make long speeches, it doesn't go on and on, why must I?
- It does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished
- There is only one day: today

Observe, decide, act
- Look at it, see the things as they are 

Best things are free. I already have 99% what I can have. Why chase 1%? 
- The price is my time and life 
- I can complain or appreciate 
- I can live life as a game 
- I can choose when to stop 

Let go, move on
- It's not personal, it doesn't matter
- Arguments are a waste of time
- I don't have to react 

I choose to be a friend  
- Take care of body and mind
- Take it easy
- Take a walk
- Start chats
- Get all the help you can

This too shall pass 
- I will stand up for what I believe, it makes enemies but it's fine 

Deliberate effortful practice 
- One bit at a time, walk slowly but walk

Silver arrows, golden silence
- Do or do not, say or say not, speak loud and clear
