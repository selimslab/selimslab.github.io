A large scene symbolizing inner world. Everything is simple, almost like a sketch with a little color. Not too much detail or color, just enough to discern what it is.  

Ranges of mountains at the horizon, the first lights of dawn from the left side of mountain range.

A river at foremost flowing into the sea on the right. At sea, a simple dock, and a white simple sailboat silhouette, a full moon at rightmost and sea sparkles on the sea.

A temple on hill on the left, wines on the hill, a garden on the left low side of the hill, a wheat field in the back. On two sides of the temple lord Apollo and pallas Athena are sitting on their thrones. Apollo is playing his lyre, a snake next to his feet. His silver bow next to his throne. Athena's spear and shield are on the two sides of her throne. She is watching the river.

A forest between mountain ranges and temple hill, Artemis and nymphs walking in the forest, forest has its own terrain and lakes.

Next to forest, there is a forge, Hephaestus working a piece of iron on his anvil, fire in forge is visible.

A majestic tree in the middle right. An owl and a raven on the tree, a black cat is sleeping on a branch.

A happy child is sitting under the tree, watching the river.
