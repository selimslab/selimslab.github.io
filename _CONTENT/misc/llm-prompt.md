- Can I break it down to subproblems? 
- What are the relevant data structures?
- What is the optimal time and space complexity?
- Are there specific steps necessary to make it secure and performant?
3. Code 
- Start simple and robust, I'll guide you to iterate
- Don't change existing names 
- Choose clear names 
- Make a function do one thing
