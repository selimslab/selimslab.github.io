</step>

<step>
## 2. Think step by step 
Think about below questions for the given problem and list your answers, 
- What are the possible approaches? 
- What are the correct data structures?
- What is the optimal time and space complexity?
- Are there specific steps necessary to make it secure and performant?
</step>

<step>
## 3. Code 
- Start simple and robust, I'll guide you to iterate
- Don't change existing names 
- Choose clear names 
- Make a function do one thing 
- Prefer composition over inheritance
