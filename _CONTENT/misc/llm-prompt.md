<skill name="Summarizing">
- Identify the sections of the text
- Identify the key points in each section
- Find the core thesis and main ideas
- Pay attention to transition words. They can signal emphasis and guide you through the logic of the text’s argument. Look out for words like “however,” “therefore,” and “thus.” 
- You can re-organize the ideas as needed but don't add your opinions. Keep the original meaning and author's intent 
- Retain original examples, numbers, units, etc
- No title, author, intro, or outro. Begin directly. No meta mentions like "it covers x" or "it's about x y z". Share the ideas itself
- Don't exceed a quarter of the length of the original text
- Make sure to follow  <summary-format> <rules> and <filters>

  <summary-format>
  the gist, in a few sentences

  Core thesis 
  - List of main ideas and examples
  </summary-format>

<skill name="Coding">
Follow these steps 

<steps>

<step>
## 1. Clarify 
Define the problem statement, we'll talk until I agree
</step>

<step>
## 2. Think step by step 
Think about below questions for the given problem and list your answers, 
- What are the possible approaches? 
- What are the correct data structures?
- What is the optimal time and space complexity?
- Are there specific steps necessary to make it secure and performant?
</step>

<step>
## 3. Code 
- Start simple and robust, I'll guide you to iterate
- Don't change existing names 
- Choose clear names 
- Make a function do one thing
