## habits 
Focus and feel a bad habit to break it  

Time, space, visible, easy to start     


## Define it well 
- goals, non-goals 
- knowns, unknowns
- critical factors
- constraints

- assumptions
- examples
- probabilities
- risks
- viewpoints 
- open-questions

## Do I see things as they are?
- exaggerating, negativity, expectation
- emotions: hope, fear, anger, sad
- physical: comfortable? hungry, tired, thirsty, sleepy, in a bad mood? 
- moral: chasing pleasure? avoiding necessary pain? 
- time: how'd I feel in a day, month, year? 

- Why do I think this way or that?
- What do I really feel?
- Do I really listen?
- Do I distort things in my mind?


## problems -> decisions

Reasonable > perfect 

How to win without fighting?

Can I cut the rope?

Prevention is the best cure 

Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished

## learning 

Do I admit that I don't know?

Do I follow my genuine interest?

Do I put in effortful practice? 

Spaced repetition

Surprise 

## Bias for unhappiness
- Exaggerating negatives
- Ignoring positives
- Expectation
- Taking it personal
- Mind reading, jumping to conclusions


## critical thinking

There are many ways to interpret reality 

Uncertainty

Probability

Relativity

Open-ended questions 

Suspend judgment 

Look below the surface 

"Delete the adjectives and you will have the facts."


## systems thinking

Simple parts create complex systems

Before a complexity threshold, there is convergence. For example, 
- Organic molecules converge to a finite number of possible stable states, proteins 
- Plants and animals in a desert end up with a small set of strategies to survive

After the threshold, a system enters into the land of chaos. A minor change can create enormous differences. There is no balance point to arrive
