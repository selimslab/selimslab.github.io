win without fight
cut the rope

## perception vs reality

Do I see things as they are?

stupidity = wrong mental model

body: comfortable, hungry, tired, thirsty, sleepy

mind: strong emotions? feeling clear?

bias: false assumptions, pessimism, expectation, exaggeration

time: how'd I feel in a day, month, year?

optimism is the rational choice


## systems

simple rules

convergence: desert plants, stable molecules

divergence after a complexity threshold, no balance to arrive, unstability
