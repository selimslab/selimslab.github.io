Day by day, what you choose is who you become 

Nothing in excess

Treat people with kindness, for I don't know what battles they are fighting. Do I not deserve my own kindness, too?

Can I live as if playing a game, playing music, losing myself in the process? Living from the heart 

The world is full of nonsense. It's not personal. It doesn't matter. Don't let it get you down.
