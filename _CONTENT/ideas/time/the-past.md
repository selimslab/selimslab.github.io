title: Learn and move on

"Hell is truth seen too late"

Many inputs come together and create an outcome, it's not all your fault. The past had to be this way given all the factors. 

Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes mistakes. 

[[prudence]]

We blame ourselves but most things are so random. Much of what we get, we don't deserve. 

Neither blame yourself nor others. Forgive yourself, forgive others. Leave the baggage. 

Would you treat a beloved friend as you treat yourself? Be kind to yourself. If you won't, who will? 

Learn from the past and move on.

"You can spend minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even months over-analyzing a situation; trying to put the pieces together, justifying what could've, would've happened... or you can just leave the pieces on the floor and move the fuck on.‚Äù


"Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly."
