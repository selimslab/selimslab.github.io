"May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out"

## It'll be over 

This too shall pass

Every night has a morning, every winter has a spring 

> If you are going through hell, keep going

"There will come soft rains"

## Be easy on yourself 

> The pain is neither unbearable nor unending,  
> as long as you keep in mind its limits,  
> and don't magnify them in your imagination  

"The mind can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven"

"It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.”

Walk no more in shadows 

## Face it 

Difficulties vanish when faced boldly

> Under the bludgeonings of chance,  
> My head is bloody, but unbowed

Cast aside fear and regret, do the deed at hand

> Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer  
> The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,  
> Or to take arms against a sea of troubles  

"This is not misfortune, to bear this worthily is good fortune"

## Do what you can 

Action is the antidote to despair. 

The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something

## There's still some good worth figthing for 

Try to appreciate whatever good you can see in this world. 

"Courage is found in unlikely places."

## Come out better on the other side 

Channel your pain to build strength. 

When you come out of the storm, you won't be the same person who walked in

> Who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived  
> or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?  


## Before the storm 

Prepare if you can but worry not 

There'll be hard times but until then, don't stress for little things  

Don't be unhappy before the crisis comes.
