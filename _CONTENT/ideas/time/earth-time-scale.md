title: If the Earth is 45 years old  
---

The earth is about 4.5 billion years old

Let's take it down to human-scale and say the Earth is 45 years old

Then the Milky Way would be 136 years old

**For the 45 years old Mother Earth,** 

a century is 30 seconds, 

a thousand years is 5 minutes, 

a human life is seconds for **a 138 years old universe**
