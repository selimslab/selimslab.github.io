A tree might seem like a separate thing but it could not exist without water, soil, and the sun. You take a tree and the sun comes with it. 

> "The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” ― Carl Sagan, Cosmos

Take anything and the whole universe comes with it 

You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars

Things define and complete each other, they are sides of the same coin 

Now our minds are one
