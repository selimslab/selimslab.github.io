> Very little is needed to make a happy life;  
> it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking  

"Something to do, someone to love, something to hope for.‚Äù

Health, freedom, security, love, friendship, flourishing, .. 

"Happiness always looks small while you hold it in your hands, but let it go, and you learn at once how big and precious it is." _Maxim Gorky_

Don't waste your time in anger, regret, worry, and hate. Not worth it. 

A good life is not something ready made. It comes from [[choice]], from your own actions
