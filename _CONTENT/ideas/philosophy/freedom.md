Being free from pains of body and mind

It's not having no responsibility or problems. Overcoming obstacles is a pleasure in itself, and I am still free to choose my attitude in the face of adversity.  

Being free from pain, regret, anxiety, anger, greed, fear, egoism, and other troubles of mind

I don't mean avoiding emotions, I should feel and accept but I can choose to not be controlled by them. I can interpret them as signals and make my own decisions
