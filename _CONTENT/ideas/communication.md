## Listening 

Do I really listen people or just hear them to answer? 

Do I automatically form opinions, deal judgment, or put things in buckets or do I listen with an open mind? 

Do I listen as if I already know it or do I listen with a beginner's mind?

Do I give advice without being asked for it?

Do I take it personal? Is it really personal? And so what even if it is?

Do I look for and listen for what is not being said, too?

## Speaking 

I promise myself to say nothing if I don't believe it. I will think twice before speaking, I'll think ten times before promising.

Do I look to the situation and see it for what it is? Did I reason about it? What is a reasonable course of action here? 

What is my goal, what is my message?

How is my attitude? Am I constructive? Am I trying to prove something? What is my aim? How do I feel? What is the emotional dynamic at play

Am I judging? offering excuses? rambling? exaggerating? gossiping? being negative? not listening? 

People can't read minds. Something being obvious to me doesn't mean it's obvious to them 

A compliment is like a small gift 

Let the silence be, it's powerful and necessary
