"The content of your character is your choice. Day by day, what you choose, what you think, and what you do is who you become."  

"Your ideas determine the quality of your life, your soul takes on the color of your thoughts"  

"Well-being is attained little by little, and nevertheless is no little thing itself"

Real wealth is building character. Applying your qualities. Healing your wounds. Facing your dark side.

Nothing in excess. Simple things are the best. 

Neither chase nor avoid, feel and let go. 

Do what feels right over what you crave.

Do nothing in anger. 

The world is full of nonsense. It's not personal. It doesn't matter. Don't let it get you down. 

Complain less, appreciate more. 

Channel your pain to build strength. This too shall pass. 

"Circumstances don't make the man but reveal him"  

Live as if you play a game, as if you listen to music, or you play music. Do not expect to "get" anything. The aim is the play itself 

Truth has many faces. Even all the knowledge of humanity is next to nothing. Judge less, accept more. 

Listen more than you speak. Know your limits. Don't take yourself too seriously. 

Never miss a good chance to shut up.
