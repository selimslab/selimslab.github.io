- Prevent problems before they happen - [[do-without-doing]]

- Look at it, see it for what it is
- Think twice before you speak. Think ten times before you promise
- Due diligence
- Take risks based on analysis  
- Probabilistic thinking 

- Do nothing that doesn't feel right
- Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain.
- Don't make decisions under physical discomfort or heavy emotion
- Don't get stuck. If you don't choose, the world will choose it for you 

- Once you decide, don't second guess, follow through 
- Don't judge decisions by results, a good decision can have a bad outcome, it's luck 

[[cognitive-biases]]

Not all decision are the same. 

- Will I be glad for this decision in a day? in a week, month, year?
