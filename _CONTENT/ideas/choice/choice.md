"making the best of your circumstances"

Everything can be taken from a man but one thing, 

the last of the human freedoms, 

to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, 

to choose one's own way.

_Viktor E. Frankl_

Day by day, what you choose is who you become 

Nothing in excess

Treat people with kindness, for I don't know what battles they are fighting. Do I not deserve my own kindness, too?

Can I live as if playing a game, playing music, losing myself in the process? Living from the heart 

The world is full of nonsense. It's not personal. It doesn't matter. Don't let it get you down.
