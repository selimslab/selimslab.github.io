title: Teamwork
---

People trust surgical teams with their lives because everyone in the team is an expert in their job, they trust each other, and they work together, leading to unparalleled professional prowess

However hard you work, the results are limited by a single person.

Nothing great is built alone but by working effectively in groups.

A team in harmony covers weaknesses and amplifies strengths. 

[[mastery]] -> [[respect]] -> [[trust]] -> Autonomy -> Harmony

## How to build a team
- Everyone should clearly understand the reason, motivation, and [intent](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_(military)>)

- Lead by example, words are forgotten but actions not

- A clear owner for every area of responsibility

- Highly trained and talented leaders, autonomous in decisions of their area

- Consistency and certainty in rewards and consequences

- The right person in the right place

- Build projects around motivated people. Provide the environment, remove obstacles

- Focus on the important few. [[do-one-thing-at-a-time-and-do-it-well]]

> 'Manage the top line, and the bottom line will follow.' What's the top line? It's things like, why are we doing this in the first place? What's our strategy? What are customers saying? How responsive are we? Do we have the best products and the best people? Those are the kind of questions you have to focus on.

- Balance data with intuition and experience. Not every important thing is measurable

- There is no single leadership style that suits all

## What not to do

- Trying to prove your worth
- Insecurity
- Micromanaging
- Not delegating
- Competing with reports
- Complaining
- Treating people like kids, the workplace is not day-care

- Single management style, mostly the style in which you prefer to be managed
- Hiring people like yourself

- Being all-business, viewing people as "resources"

- Impatience
- Not listening well
- Not asking the right questions

- Don't let people pressure you into decisions you don't believe in. They'll hold _you_ responsible for them later, and they'll be right. Decisions are your responsibility.
