"Do you think that I count the days? There is only one day left, always starting over: it is given to us at dawn and taken away from us at dusk.”
― Jean-Paul Sartre


Life is not short but I waste large parts of it. I can explore the beauty and wisdom of all the ages before me, it extends my life beyond my time. 

Time flows silently, it won't remind me how fast it is. There are no edits. 

Do I choose what I follow? 

Do I really want to do it? If so, why do it put it off? I don't want to do it right now. Then what's a good time to do it? 

The early years seem so long because they are full of firsts.  I can slow down time by trying new things, travelling, and spending more time with people I like 

Is death really in the future? Whatever time has passed is already gone

I can't lose what I don't have. I only have today. How can I lose something that's not mine?
