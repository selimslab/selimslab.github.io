Mastery comes from focus and deliberate practice, from saying no to many good ideas to pursue important ones 

"A distracted mind can't successfully pursue any activity, since a distracted mind absorbs nothing deeply"

A wide variety of experiences might lead to well-roundedness, but not to greatness, nor even goodness.

For example, musicians get better by tackling harder and harder pieces, not by switching instruments or genres, nor by learning more and varied easy pieces. 

You don't level up by switching games all the time, but by sticking with one long enough to gain advanced skills.

Less ego, more mastery
