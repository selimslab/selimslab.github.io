**What is the next action?**

Define the top goal, the most important thing. Say no to all else 

Break it down to steps. Eliminate, delegate, batch, define deadlines 

## Tactics 
- checklists
- checkpoints
- write  
- draw  
- end it with a cliffhanger 
- do mini tasks right away
- save some easy tasks for low-motivation periods
- early morning, fresh mind
- Ignore sunk costs
- Work short, focused intervals and rest
