Practice - I need deliberate, effortful practice. Practice that challenges me and oushes my limits 

My ego prevents me from getting better. It says "you are already good enough, why bother?" 

Distractions lure me away, browsing reddit is easier than thinking about a problem 

My mind races with ideas, I should say no most of them. I must focus on the important ones

Depth vs breadth - a wide variety of experiences can be good earlier in life. Mastery takes depth. Taking on harder and harder pieces.
