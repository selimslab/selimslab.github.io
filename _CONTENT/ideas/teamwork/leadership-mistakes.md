- Trying to prove your worth
- Insecurity
- Micromanaging
- Not delegating
- Competing with reports
- Complaining
- Treating people like kids, the workplace is not day-care

- Single management style, mostly the style in which you prefer to be managed
- Hiring people like yourself

- Being all-business, viewing people as "resources"

- Impatience
- Not listening well
- Not asking the right questions

- Don't let people pressure you into decisions you don't believe in. They'll hold _you_ responsible for them later, and they'll be right. Decisions are your responsibility.
