title: Teamwork

People trust surgical teams with their lives because everyone in the team is an expert in their job, they trust each other, and they work together, leading to unparalleled professional prowess

However hard you work, the results are limited by a single person.

Nothing great is built alone but by working effectively in groups.

A team in harmony covers weaknesses and amplifies strengths.
