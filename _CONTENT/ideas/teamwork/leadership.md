- Highly trained and talented leaders, autonomous in decisions of their area

- Consistency and certainty in rewards and consequences

> 'Manage the top line, and the bottom line will follow.' What's the top line? It's things like, why are we doing this in the first place? What's our strategy? What are customers saying? How responsive are we? Do we have the best products and the best people? Those are the kind of questions you have to focus on.
