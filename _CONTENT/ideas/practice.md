Practice - I need deliberate, effortful practice. Practice that challenges me and pushes my limits 

My ego prevents me from getting better. It says "you are already good enough, why bother?" 

Distractions lure me away, browsing reddit is easier than effortful practice

My mind races with ideas, only few are important

Depth vs breadth - a wide variety of experiences can be good earlier in life. Mastery takes depth. Taking on harder and harder pieces.
