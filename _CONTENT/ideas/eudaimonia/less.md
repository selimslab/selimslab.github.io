"The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it"

Remove all nonessentials. Speak less, think less, do less, have less. Recharge

"This is a matter of freedom. If you don't have many possessions then you don't need to work all your life like a slave to sustain them, and therefore you have more time for yourself.”

— Jose Mujica, 40th President of Uruguay


## Wait a bit before buying something 

"I end up not buying a lot of things. Because I find them ridiculous." Steve Jobs 

Material things have the worst kind of hedonic adaptation. They come through great toil; kept by great anxiety. 

Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben. 

What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.
