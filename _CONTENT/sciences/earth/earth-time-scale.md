The earth is about 4.5 billion years old

Let's take it to human-scale and say the Earth is 45 years old

Then the Milky Way would be 136 years old and the known universe is 138 years old

**For the 45 years old Mother Earth,**

A decade is 3 seconds

30 seconds is a century, 5 minutes a thousand years

The last hour is the past 12 000 years 

A human life is 20-30 seconds at most, in a 138 years old universe
