Basic building blocks follow simple rules and create complex systems

Before a complexity threshold, there is convergence. For example, 
- Organic molecules converge to a finite number of possible stable states, proteins 
- Plants and animals in a desert end up with a small set of strategies to survive

After the threshold, a system enters into the land of chaos. A minor change can create enormous differences. There is no balance point to arrive
