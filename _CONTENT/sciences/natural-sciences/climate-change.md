The planet was here long before us, it'll be here long after us. Human actions are trivial for the planet (see [[earth-time-scale]]), yet we are still able to make the place a hell for our children.  

It's possible to protect oceans, forests, mountains, and the life on earth. Nature will heal itself when we stop our abuse. 

We must pressure politicians and corporations. No effort is too small, every little action will inspire more people
