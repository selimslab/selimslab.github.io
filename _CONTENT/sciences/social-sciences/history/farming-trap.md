Jared Diamond argues that agriculture, supposedly our most decisive step toward progress, was actually a catastrophe.

Hunter-gatherers had diverse diets, ample leisure time, fit bodies, deep connection with nature, and superb survival skills - like free wild animals compared to farm animals.

### Key Evidence

1. **Health Declined**
   - Skeletal evidence shows height decreased after agriculture (5'9" to 5'3" for men)
   - 50% increase in malnutrition markers
   - 4x increase in anemia
   - 3x increase in infectious disease
   - Life expectancy dropped from 26 to 19 years

2. **Nutrition Worsened**
   - Hunter-gatherers ate diverse foods (75+ wild plants for Bushmen)
   - Farmers relied on few starchy crops lacking essential nutrients
   - Modern hunter-gatherers consume more calories and protein than recommended

3. **Social Inequality Emerged**
   - No stored food meant no elite class could exist before farming
   - Agriculture enabled non-producing elites to control resources
   - Class divisions appeared (royal skeletons taller with better teeth)
   - Gender inequality increased (women as burden-bearers, more frequent pregnancies)

4. **Disease Spread**
   - Crowded settlements enabled epidemics
   - Tuberculosis, measles, plague required dense populations

### Why We Adopted Agriculture

- Not by choice but necessity to feed growing populations
- Farming supported more people (100x density) but with poorer quality of life
- Agricultural societies outbred and conquered hunter-gatherers
- "Might makes right" - 100 malnourished farmers could defeat one healthy hunter

### Historical Perspective

- Hunter-gatherers thrived for 99% of human existence
- Agriculture appeared only in the final minutes of our evolutionary "day"
- We're still struggling with the consequences of this transition
