Jared Diamond argues that agriculture was catastrophe, not progress

Hunter-gatherers had diverse diets, ample leisure time, fit bodies, deep connection with nature, and superb survival skills - like free wild animals compared to farm animals.

- Hunter-gatherers thrived for 99% of human existence
- Agriculture appeared only in the final minutes of our evolutionary "day"
- People adopted agriculture not by choice but necessity to feed growing populations
- Farming supported more people (100x density) but with poorer quality of life
- Agricultural societies outbred and conquered hunter-gatherers
- "Might makes right" - 100 malnourished farmers could defeat one healthy hunter

- Hunter-gatherers ate diverse foods (75+ wild plants for Bushmen)
- Farmers relied on few starchy crops lacking essential nutrients
- Life expectancy dropped from 26 to 19 years
- No stored food meant no elite class could exist before farming
- Agriculture enabled elite classes
- Class and gender divisions appeared
- Crowded settlements enabled epidemics like plague
