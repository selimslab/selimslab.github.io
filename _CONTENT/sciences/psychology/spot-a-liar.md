These are not proof of deception but when they come in clusters, this is your signal

Jests, mimics, fake smiles, too little or too much eye contact

Liers may look down, lower voice, set up a barrier, pepper it with irrelevant details

Let go of your anger and contempt.

Switch to the curiosity mode.

Ask specific questions, go backward.
