## Prep
- Define your goals and limits

## Mindset 
- Approach it as a discovery, not battle
- Emotions make decisions, reason justifies later.
- A good story - soothes fears, excites hope, gets across the key arguments
- Arguments dilute each other

## Listen
- Read the room, voices, body languages, nonverbal cues 
- The listener is in charge
- How can I stay calm and constructive? Can I look at it from their perspective? What's the next action? 
- Do I notice any [[cognitive-biases]] or dark patterns? anchors, loss aversion, false-urgency, etc?
- How can make them arrive at the conclusion themselves? If I say it outright, there'll be resistance but if they arrive themselves, they embrace it their own idea

## Speak 
- Paraphrase, summarize, mirror
- Label fears, list the worst cases, spread it open on the table 
- Ask open-ended questions, how and what
- Pause after you talk
- Confirm with summaries and how questions
