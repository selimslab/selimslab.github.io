Il faut cultiver notre jardin

These violent delights have violent ends  

May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out  

Ride, ride for ruin And the world's ending  

What are men to rocks and mountains?  

The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.

I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree

It's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then  

Hell is empty and all the devils are here  

We wear the mask that grins and lies  

Sub specie aeternitatis  

Stand at the brink of the abyss of despair, and when you see that you cannot bear it anymore, draw back a little and have a cup of tea

Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment  

O snail Climb Mount Fuji, But slowly, slowly!  

Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.  

Walk no more in shadows  

All is well that ends well

Courage is found in unlikely places  

Ars longa, vita brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile  

I pensieri stretti ed il viso sciolto  

Many that live deserve death  And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment  

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

Hands of a king are hands of a healer  

All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream  

My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!  

For even the very wise cannot see all ends  

Was du erlebst, kann keine macht der Welt dir rauben  

I read a book one day and my whole life was changed  

How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live  

Even the darkest night will end, and the sun will rise

Old pond... a frog jumps in water's sound  

Fear is the mind-killer  

Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not

Whether to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will  

Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
