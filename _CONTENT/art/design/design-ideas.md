- Design is the core, expressing itself in successive layers.
- Good design resembles a likable person: respectful, generous, helpful.
- Know thy user; you are not your user.
- Don't design for everyone; it makes everyone unhappy.
- Design for how people behave, not how you wish them to behave.
- Ask about specific past problems and their solutions.
- Test early and often; three test-and-fix cycles with five users.
- Design is like a mom; nobody notices her presence, but everyone misses her absence.
- It's simple enough if the user can easily and intuitively grasp how it works.
- Take hints from the past.
- Be mindful of emotions; soothe fears, use nostalgia, give hope.
- Design can be evil [[hijacked-minds]]
