Good design is respectful to your time and energy 
- It is easy to figure out even in an emergency. If you can, use what people are already familiar with
- It is generous, if you make a mistake, it has a sensible response 

Choose a specific audience and design for them 
- You can't make everyone happy. If you try, it'll make everyone unhappy. 

Test early and often
- Find five people down the hall and test in a real setting. 
- Do it three times and you'll find most of the problems with your design. 

Be mindful of emotions

Take hints from the past
- Ask your users about specific problems in the past and their approach

Design can be evil [[hijacked-minds]]
