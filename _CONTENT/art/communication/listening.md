Set aside your opinion. Listen with a **beginner's mind**

**Listen to understand**, not to answer, not to offer solutions. People often share a problem or vulnerability for emotional support, not for advice or solutions. Give neither salt nor counsel till you are asked for it.

Suspend judgment, it's not personal, it's not about you. 

Listen to **what isn't being said**, too
