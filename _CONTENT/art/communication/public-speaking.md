What is my message? What is my thesis and key points?

Do I speak like reading written word or do I speak from the heart? 

Do I use both short and long sentences?

Do I smile occasionaly when I speak?

Do I have eye contact with the audience?

Do I ramble? Why do I have to continue, what prevents me from moving on to the next point now? I don't have to tell everything that comes to my mind.
