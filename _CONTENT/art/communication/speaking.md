Words are irreversible. Think twice before you speak. Think ten times before you promise

Don't say it if you don't believe it

Emotions drive the conversation. Have a constructive attitude. Say something good or say nothing

Avoid negativity, judging, excuses, exaggeration, or gossip 

No need to prove anything 

People can't read minds. Something being obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to them 

Don't say "I told you, so" It achieves bitterness only

A compliment is like a small gift 

Don't fill the silence
