The way to do anything great

People should come together because of genuine interest

Remove obstacles 

Lead by example 

A team in harmony covers weaknesses and amplifies strengths

Clear owners 

Highly trained people, autonomus in their area 

Consistency, clarity, certainty in rewards and consequences 

The right person in the right place

Balance data with intuition and experience. Not every important thing is measurable

Few things are important 

Manage the top line and the bottom line will follow 

What if I believe in people, what if I treat people as what they could be 

People trust surgical teams with their lives because everyone in the team is an expert in their job, they trust each other, and they work together, leading to unparalleled professional prowess
