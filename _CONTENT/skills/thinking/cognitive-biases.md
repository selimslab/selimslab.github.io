Do I choose it because it's the right way or because it's easy?

Am I doing this just to feel better?

Do I oversimplify? exaggerate?

Is it a prejudice?

Do I apply a double standard here?

Do I jump to conclusions?

Why do I make this decision? 

What drives me here?

What's under this emotion?

Do I believe it because it makes sense or because it's a good story?

It's easy to notice mistakes of others. Am I aware of my own?

Am I aware of my weaknesses? Do I downplay them to myself? 

Am I trying to change people? read minds? predict future?

Is this comparison useful? 

Is this negativity warranted?

Is this regret or worry preparing me or just wearing me down? Am I just fearing ghosts and crying over spilt milk?

Is this a strategic risk, an informed bet, or am I just gambling?

How does the environment affect me?

Do I care to choose my friends?

Am I blindly following the herd?

Do I believe that people think about me that much? They're not

Do I constrain myself unnecessarily?

Am I doing something just because I am restless? 

How would it feel a few hours later? next morning? next week? month? year?

Is this a good place to stop?
