- Should I say it? in this tone? with these words? 
- Am I promising anything? Can I make it more clear to prevent misunderstandings?
- What is the due diligence for this decision? How much is enough, how much is too little or too much?
- What are the criticial factors? What to focus on here?
- How do the probabilities look here?
- Am I chasing pleasure? Am I avoiding necessary pain? 
- Am I exaggerating in my head? 
- Do I feel comfortable? Am I hungry, tired, thirsty, sleepy, or in a bad mood? 
- Can I cut the rope?
- How to win without fighting?
- Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished
- How realistic is to expect perfect decisions? As long as I follow a reasonable process, do I have anything to worry about?
