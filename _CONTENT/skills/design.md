## Don Norman 

Design is really an act of communication, which means having a deep understanding of the person with whom the designer is communicating.

"What makes something simple or complex? It's not the number of dials or controls or how many features it has: It is whether the person using the device has a good conceptual model of how it operates."

Principles of design:
1. Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head.
2. Simplify the structure of tasks.
3. Make things visible: bridge gulfs between Execution and Evaluation.
4. Get the mappings right.
5. Exploit the power of constraints.
6. Design for error.
7. When all else fails, standardize.

Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible

In design, one of the most difficult activities is to get the specifications right

Fail often, fail fast

Any time you see signs or labels added to a device, it is an indication of bad design

- Design is the core and it keeps expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.
- Good design resembles a likable person: respectful, generous and helpful.

- Know thy user and you are not your user
- Don't design for everyone. It makes everyone unhappy.

- Design for the way people behave, not for how you wish them to behave.
- Ask about specific problems in the past and what they did about them
- Test early and often
- Three test-and-fix cycles with 5 users

* [[do-one-thing-at-a-time-and-do-it-well]]

- Design is like a mom, nobody notices when she's around, but everybody misses her when she's not.
- Its simple enough if the user can easily and intuitively grasp how it works

* Take hints from the past

* Be mindful of emotions, soothe fears, use nostalgia, give hope
* Design can be evil [[hijacked-minds]]

Ship it

Usage is like oxygen for ideas.

You can't make it better until you make it work.

"Release early. Release often.”

A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.
