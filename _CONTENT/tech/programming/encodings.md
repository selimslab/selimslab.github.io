## language-specific

eg. python pickle 
   
restricted to one language and they have poor back/forward compatibility

## text

eg. json, csv

More generic, better human-readable, better compatibility than the former 

## binary

eg. protobuf, thrift 

more compact 

need to be decoded to be human readable

## Paths 
1. via DBs 
2. via services, eg. REST, RPC  
3. via message passing, eg. brokers, actors
