## When listening 

Set aside your opinion. Listen with a **beginner's mind**

**Listen to understand**, not to answer, not to offer solutions. People often share a problem or vulnerability for emotional support, not for advice or solutions. Give neither salt nor counsel till you are asked for it.

Suspend judgment, it's not personal, it's not about you. 

Listen to **what isn't being said**, too 

## When speaking 

Words are irreversible. Think twice before you speak. Be careful with promises

Say something good or say nothing

Don't say it if you don't believe it

Emotions drive the conversation. Have a positive, constructive attitude. 

Avoid negativity, judging, excuses, exaggeration, or gossip 

Don't try to prove anything, people believe what they want to believe. 

People can't read minds. Something being obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to them 

Frequent sharing organizes thoughts
