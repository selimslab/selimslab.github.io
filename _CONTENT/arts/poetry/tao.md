Insight sees the insignificant.

Strength knows how to yield.

---

Hollowed out

clay makes a pot, 

where the pot's not,

is where it's useful

"You don't have to go out the door

to know what goes on in the world.

You don't have to look out the window

to see the way of heaven.

The farther you go,

the less you know."

---

"People whose power is real fulfill their obligations;

people whose power is hollow insist on their claims.”

---

"Living people

are soft and tender.

Corpses are hard and stiff.

The ten thousand things,

the living grass, the trees,

are soft, pliant.

Dead, they're dry and brittle.”

---

The more ingenious the skillful are,

the more monstrous their inventions.

The louder the call for law and order,

the more the thieves and con men multiply.

---

Alas! misery lies under happiness,

and happiness sits on misery, alas!

Who knows where it will end?

Nothing is certain.

---

The normal changes into the monstrous,

the fortunate into the unfortunate,

and our bewilderment

goes on and on.

---

The great ruler speaks little

and his words are priceless

He works without self-interest

and leaves no trace

When all is finished, the people say,

"It happened by itself"
