Do without doing.

Act without action.

Savor the flavorless.

Treat the small as large,

the few as many.

---

Meet injury

with the power of goodness.

---

Study the hard while it's easy.

Do big things while they're small.

The hardest jobs in the world start out easy,

the great affairs of the world start small.

---

Now, since taking things too lightly makes them worthless,

and taking things too easy makes them hard,

the wise soul,

by treating the easy as hard,

doesn't find anything hard.

---

Solve it in the beginning, 

while its small and easy, 

by never dealing with great things,

gets great things done.
