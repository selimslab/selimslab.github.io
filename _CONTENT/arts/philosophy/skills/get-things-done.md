**What is the next action?**

What is my top goal today?

How to break it down?

What's one little thing to get me started?

Can I eliminate? delegate? batch? timebox? 


## Tactics 
- checklists
- checkpoints
- write  
- draw  
- end it with a cliffhanger 
- do mini tasks right away
- save some easy tasks for low-motivation periods
- early morning, fresh mind
- Ignore sunk costs
- Work short, focused intervals and rest
