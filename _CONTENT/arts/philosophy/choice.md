Everything can be taken from a man but one thing, 

the last of the human freedoms, 

to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, 

to choose one's own way.

_Viktor E. Frankl_

"Were I to wish for anything I would not wish for wealth and power, 

but for the passion of the possible, 

that eye which everywhere, ever young, ever burning, sees possibility. 

Pleasure disappoints, not possibility."

_SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard_
