'good spirit', 'happiness' 'welfare', 'flourishing'

Life is a set of events, one after another. Often with little rhyme or reason. 

I don't have to be "happy" to have a good life. 

How can bear the accidents of life with dignity and grace?

How can I make the best out of my circumstances?

How can I know myself better

How can I make tough choices? How to face pain and darkness?

How to become a friend to myself and others?
