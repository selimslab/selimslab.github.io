Do I give my body and mind a fighting chance? Do I relax and enjoy life enough? 

Do I follow my genuine interest? 

How do I feel about my direction? Going fast in a wrong way? 

Is this the most important thing I should be working on?

What is fun to me but work for others? What makes me lose track of time? 

What comes naturally to me? What blurs the line between work and play?

Am I playing a game where odds are in my favor? What are my limitations? 

Do I like the process or the idea of results?

What would my best version do? 

---

We are complicit in what our employers do. Would I work for people I don't respect?

Do I stay humble? Is it humility or short-selling myself? 

Do I try to hide my flaws? Conceal a thing, and the world imagines the worst 

Am I forming healthy relationships with people?

There is more outside the beaten path, I can chart my own course 

Do I own what I am working on? Can I show it? Do people see me doing it? Do my work built any lasting capital, whether skills, reputation, or social connections?

My decline is coming sooner than I think
