title: Decision Making 
---

- Prevent a problem before it happens - [[do-without-doing]]
- Look at it, see it for what it is
- Think twice before you speak
- Think ten times before you promise
- Due diligence
- Diverse perspectives 
- Do nothing that doesn't feel right
- Neither chase pleasure nor avoid necessary pain.
- Don't make decisions under physical discomfort or heavy emotion
- Don't get stuck
- Once you decide, don't second guess, follow through
