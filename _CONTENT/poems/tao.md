Nature doesn't make long speeches
A whirlwind doesn't last all morning.
A cloudburst doesn't last all day.
Who makes the wind and rain?
Heaven and earth do.
If heaven and earth don't go on and on,
Certainly, people don't need to.

---

Do without doing.
Act without action.
Savor the flavorless.
Treat the small as large,
the few as many.

---

Meet injury
with the power of goodness.

---

Study the hard while it's easy.
Do big things while they're small.
The hardest jobs in the world start out easy,
the great affairs of the world start small.

---

Now, since taking things too lightly makes them worthless,
and taking things too easy makes them hard,
the wise soul,
by treating the easy as hard,
doesn't find anything hard.

---

Solve it in the beginning,
while its small and easy,
by never dealing with great things,
gets great things done.


---

Insight sees the insignificant.
Strength knows how to yield.


---

Hollowed out
clay makes a pot,
where the pot's not,
is where it's useful

---

You don't have to go out the door
to know what goes on in the world.
You don't have to look out the window
to see the way of heaven.
The farther you go,
the less you know.


---

People whose power is real fulfill their obligations;
people whose power is hollow insist on their claims.”

---

Living people
are soft and tender.
Corpses are hard and stiff.
The ten thousand things,
the living grass, the trees,
are soft, pliant.
Dead, they're dry and brittle.”

---

The more ingenious the skillful are,
the more monstrous their inventions.
The louder the call for law and order,
the more the thieves and con men multiply.

---

Alas! misery lies under happiness,
and happiness sits on misery, alas!
Who knows where it will end?
Nothing is certain.

---

The normal changes into the monstrous,
the fortunate into the unfortunate,
and our bewilderment
goes on and on.

---

The great ruler speaks little
and his words are priceless
He works without self-interest
and leaves no trace
When all is finished, the people say,
It happened by itself
