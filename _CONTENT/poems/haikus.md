古池や　蛙飛び込む　水の音

Furu ike ya
kawazu tobikomu
mizu no oto


Old pond…
a frog jumps in
water's sound


A world of dew,
And within every dewdrop
A world of struggle.


O snail
Climb Mount Fuji,
But slowly, slowly!

so much depends  
upon

a red wheel  
barrow

glazed with rain  
water

beside the white  
chickens
