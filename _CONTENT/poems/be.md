Beautiful is the moment,
When the heart indifferent
To joy or sorrow, just trusts
Whatever this life brings
But finds time to just be.

It's dark because you are trying too hard.
Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly.
Yes, feel lightly even though you're feeling deeply.
Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them.

Aldous Huxley, Island
