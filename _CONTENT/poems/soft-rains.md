title: There Will Come Soft Rains
---

There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,  
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;
And frogs in the pools singing at night,  
And wild plum trees in tremulous white,
Robins will wear their feathery fire  
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;
And not one will know of the war, not one  
Will care at last when it is done.
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree  
If mankind perished utterly;
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,  
Would scarcely know that we were gone.
