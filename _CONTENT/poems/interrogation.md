Step forward: we hear  
That you are a good man.  
You cannot be bought, but the lightning  
Which strikes the house, also  
Cannot be bought.  
You hold to what you said.  
But what did you say?  
You are honest, you say your opinion.  
Which opinion?  
You are brave.  
Against whom?  
You are wise.  
For whom?  
You do not consider your personal advantages.  
Whose advantages do you consider then?  
You are a good friend.  
Are you also a good friend of the good people?  
  
Hear us then: we know.  
You are our enemy. This is why we shall  
Now put you in front of a wall. But in consideration of your merits and good qualities  
We shall put you in front of a good wall and shoot you  
With a good bullet from a good gun and bury you  
With a good shovel in the good earth  

_Bertolt Brecht_
