Do I really listen people or just hear them to answer? 

Do I automatically form opinions, deal judgment, or put things in buckets or do I listen with an open mind? 

Do I listen as if I already know it or do I listen with a beginner's mind?

Do I give advice without being asked for it?

Do I take it personal? Is it really personal? And so what even if it is?

Do I look for and listen for what is not being said, too?
