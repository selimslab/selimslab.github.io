## hash table 

1. Chain with linked lists, O(n) worst-case lookup
2. Chain with binary search trees, O(log n) worst-case 

## linked lists 

Detect cycle: no cycle if the fast ptr finds the end 

Get intersection: if there is one, two ptrs will meet after some iterations (if a ptr becomes null, move to head of other list)

## lru-cache 

dict+linked list
