## tradeoffs 

Bias-variance: simplicity vs complexity 

accurate vs interpretable

complexity vs generality: simpler models generalize better 

precision vs recall: 
- precise has few false positives but misses some true ones 
- high recall: more true positives but also more false ones 

F1-score: harmonic mean of both 

eg. spam detection - balance of catching more spam without marking good emails as spam
