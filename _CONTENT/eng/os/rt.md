## real-time sys 

redundant hardware, eg. cpus, sensors  

no heap
no gc
stack bound checks  

no cpu pipelines  
no cache, not even cpu cache  

no interrupts during critical sections  
deterministic bus  

no dynamic dispatch  
no recursion  

certifications  
formal methods  

special hardware  

rtos:  
no virtual memory   
priority based scheduling with guaranteed time slices 

heapsort for in place nlogn sorting
