⏺ Stream Processing: Key Practical 
  Ideas

  Event Streaming Architecture & 
  Infrastructure

  Log-Based Message Brokers for 
  Production Systems
  - Use log-based brokers (Kafka,
  Kinesis) over traditional message
  queues for high-throughput,
  fault-tolerant streaming
  - Implement partitioning for
  parallelism while maintaining
  ordering guarantees within
  partitions
  - Leverage consumer offset tracking
  for simple fault recovery and replay
   capabilities
  - Design for large disk-based
  buffers (hours/days of data) rather
  than memory-only queues

  Stream vs Batch Processing 
  Trade-offs
  - Choose streams for low-latency
  requirements and continuous
  processing needs
  - Prefer batch for complex
  operations requiring full dataset
  visibility (like sorting)
  - Use stream processing for
  incremental derivation of data
  products and real-time dashboards
  - Combine approaches: use streams
  for real-time updates and batch for
  periodic full rebuilds

  Data Integration & Synchronization 
  Patterns

  Change Data Capture (CDC) for System
   Integration
  - Implement CDC to keep derived
  systems (search indexes, caches,
  warehouses) synchronized with source
   databases
  - Use log compaction to maintain
  complete dataset state without
  infinite storage growth
  - Deploy CDC as the single source of
   truth for multi-system data
  consistency
  - Avoid dual writes which create
  race conditions and consistency
  problems

  Event Sourcing for Application 
  Design
  - Store business events as immutable
   facts rather than current state
  mutations
  - Design events at application level
   (user actions) not database level
  (row changes)
  - Build current state as
  materialized views derived from
  event streams
  - Separate command validation (can
  fail) from event recording
  (immutable facts)

  Stream Processing Patterns & 
  Operations

  Windowing and Time Management
  - Use event time (when events
  occurred) rather than processing
  time for accurate analytics
  - Implement tumbling windows for
  non-overlapping time buckets and
  hopping windows for smoothed metrics
  - Handle late-arriving events with
  configurable tolerances (ignore vs.
  corrections)
  - Account for clock skew by logging
  device time, send time, and server
  receipt time

  Stream Joins and State Management
  - Stream-stream joins: maintain
  windowed state for correlating
  related events (search + click)
  - Stream-table joins: enrich events
  with slowly-changing reference data
  using local caches
  - Table-table joins: maintain
  materialized views of joined
  datasets (Twitter timeline cache)
  - Keep join state local to stream
  processors and use changelog streams
   for updates

  Fault Tolerance & Consistency

  Exactly-Once Processing Guarantees
  - Use microbatching or checkpointing
   for fault recovery without data
  loss
  - Implement idempotent operations
  with metadata (like Kafka offsets)
  to handle retries safely
  - Apply atomic commits within stream
   processing frameworks rather than
  across heterogeneous systems
  - Design for deterministic
  processing to ensure consistent
  results on replay

  State Recovery and Durability
  - Replicate operator state through
  dedicated changelog topics with log
  compaction
  - Enable state rebuilding from input
   streams for short-window
  aggregations
  - Use periodic snapshots to durable
  storage (HDFS) for complex state
  recovery
  - Balance local vs. remote state
  based on network/disk performance
  characteristics

⏺ Stream Processing Key Practical Ideas:

  Message Broker Design
  - Use log-based brokers (Kafka) for high-throughput
  ordered processing with replay
  - Partition by key for ordering + parallelism;
  consumers ≤ partitions
  - Track consumer offsets for fault recovery

  Data Integration Patterns
  - Use Change Data Capture instead of dual writes to
  avoid race conditions
  - Event sourcing: store immutable events, derive state
   via replay
  - Log compaction: retain latest value per key for
  bounded storage

  Stream Processing Fundamentals
  - Joins: Stream-stream (windowed), stream-table
  (enrichment), table-table (materialized views)
  - Windows: Tumbling (fixed), hopping (overlapping),
  sliding (event-time), session (activity-based)
  - Time: Use event time, handle late data with grace
  periods, implement watermarks

  Fault Tolerance
  - Checkpoint state periodically or replicate to
  log-compacted topics
  - Exactly-once via idempotent operations + atomic
  commits
  - Design for deterministic replay, avoid external side
   effects

  Operational Excellence
  - Use probabilistic algorithms (HyperLogLog) for
  memory efficiency
  - Monitor consumer lag and end-to-end latency
  - Scale horizontally up to partition limits
  - Implement backpressure and graceful degradation
