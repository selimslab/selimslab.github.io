1. Start with Clear Goals

  - Define specific business outcomes before adopting
  microservices
  - Valid reasons: team autonomy, faster time to market,
  cost-effective scaling, improved robustness
  - Avoid microservices for unclear domains, startups,
  customer-installed software, or without clear reason

  2. Incremental Migration Strategy

  - Use small, reversible steps rather than big-bang
  rewrites
  - Apply "copy before cutting" - keep original
  functionality during migration
  - Separate deployment from release using feature toggles
  and progressive delivery

  3. Key Migration Patterns

  - Strangler Fig: Insert proxy to redirect traffic
  incrementally to new services
  - Branch by Abstraction: Create internal abstraction
  layer for gradual replacement
  - Parallel Run: Run old and new implementations
  simultaneously for validation
  - Change Data Capture: React to database changes when
  code modification isn't possible

  4. Database Decomposition Principles

  - Each service must own its data completely - no shared
  databases
  - Use logical separation first (schemas), then physical
  separation (engines)
  - Replace database joins with service calls, handle
  increased latency through caching/batching
  - Avoid distributed transactions - use sagas for
  cross-service business processes

  5. Team Structure Evolution

  - Move from functional teams to product-oriented teams
  owning end-to-end delivery
  - Implement strong ownership model for services
  (essential at 100+ developers)
  - Align team boundaries with service boundaries following
   Conway's Law

  6. Essential Infrastructure Investment

  - Log aggregation as first priority - foundation for all
  other monitoring
  - Service discovery and load balancing for dynamic
  service location
  - Distributed tracing with correlation IDs for debugging
  call chains
  - Automated deployment pipelines for independent service
  releases

  7. Breaking Changes Management

  - Prevent breaking changes with explicit schemas and
  expansion-only changes
  - Support both old and new contracts simultaneously
  during transitions
  - Treat service consumers as customers requiring
  migration time

  8. Monitoring & Observability

  - Implement synthetic transactions for end-to-end health
  checking
  - Build observability mindset - gather data for unknown
  future questions
  - Use dedicated reporting databases separate from
  operational stores

  9. Developer Experience Solutions

  - Service stubbing for local development with many
  dependencies
  - Hybrid local/remote development approaches
  - Consumer-driven contracts instead of large end-to-end
  test suites

  10. Risk Management

  - Design every migration step to be easily reversible
  - Start with low-risk, low-coupling services first
  - Use dependency analysis to prioritize extraction order
  (few inbound dependencies = easier)

  11. Operational Scaling

  - Implement desired state management for automatic
  service maintenance
  - Consider managed platforms (Kubernetes, serverless)
  when complexity justifies investment
  - Build service registries to prevent orphaned services

  12. Global vs Local Optimization

  - Distinguish reversible vs irreversible decisions for
  governance
  - Use technical cross-cutting groups for coordination
  without losing team autonomy
  - Balance consistency with team independence based on
  decision impact
