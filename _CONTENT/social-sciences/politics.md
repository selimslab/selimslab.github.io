The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must. Because the weak don't come together and resist. The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.

[The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/983517)

"It is incredible how as soon as a people become subject, it  
promptly falls into such complete forgetfulness of its freedom  
that it can hardly be roused to the point of regaining it,  
obeying so easily and willingly that one is led to say that this  
people has not so much lost its liberty as won its enslavement.”

"It is true that in the beginning men submit under constraint and by force; but those who come after them obey without regret and perform willingly what their predecessors had done because they had to. This is why men born under the yoke and then nourished and reared in slavery are content, without further effort, to live in their native circumstance, unaware of any other state or right, and considering as quite natural the condition into which they were born.”

"Resolve to serve no more, and you are at once freed. I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over, but simply that you support him no longer; then you will behold him, like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away, fall of his own weight and break in pieces.”  

― Étienne de La Boétie, 


"Society is much more easily soothed than one's own conscience.”
― Isaac Asimov, Foundation and Empire

Ignorance is strength.”

## A Left-Handed Commencement Address 

Ursula K. Le Guin


...

Because you are human beings you are going to meet failure. You are going to meet disappointment, injustice, betrayal, and irreparable loss. You will find you're weak where you thought yourself strong. You'll work for possessions and then find they possess you. You will find yourself -- as I know you already have -- in dark places, alone, and afraid.

...

I'm talking about society, the so-called man's world of institutionalized competition, aggression, violence, authority, and power.

...

I hope you live without the need to dominate, and without the need to be dominated. I hope you are never victims, but I hope you have no power over other people. And when you fail, and are defeated, and in pain, and in the dark, then I hope you will remember that darkness is your country, where you live, where no wars are fought and no wars are won, but where the future is.

Our roots are in the dark; the earth is our country. Why did we look up for blessing -- instead of around, and down? What hope we have lies there. Not in the sky full of orbiting spy-eyes and weaponry, but in the earth we have looked down upon. Not from above, but from below. Not in the light that blinds, but in the dark that nourishes, where human beings grow human souls.


## Questioning people are seen as a threat 

<https://www.madinamerica.com/2012/02/why-anti-authoritarians-are-diagnosed-as-mentally-ill/>

In my career as a psychologist, I have talked with hundreds of people previously diagnosed by other professionals with oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, anxiety disorder and other psychiatric illnesses, and I am struck by
(1) how many of those diagnosed are essentially anti-authoritarians,
(2) how those professionals who have diagnosed them are not.

...

So authoritarians financially marginalize those who buck the system, they criminalize anti-authoritarianism, they psychopathologize anti-authoritarians, and they market drugs for their "cure.”


## Art of War

Warfare is deception 

Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.

if you can attack, seem unable 

seem inactive if you are active 

seem far when near, near when far 


---

Pretend to be weak so they grow arrogant 

Irritate the enemy, make them angry

If you can't control your anger, you lose 

---

Attack unexpectedly. Be prepared and wait to take them unprepared
