## Search 

```
dfs(node):
    if node is not visited:
        visit node 
        for n in neighbours:
            dfs(n)

bfs(start_node):
    add start_node to q 
    while q:
        get a node from q
        if node is not visited:
            add neighbors to q 
            visit node 
```

## Sort 

```
topo(graph):  

    tfs(node):
        for n in neighbours:
            if n is not seen:
                tfs(n)

        if node is not seen:
            mark as seen 
            add to stack 

    for node in graph:
        tfs(node) 

    return reversed stack 
```


## Traversals

```
inorder(root):

    walk(node):
        if node:
            walk(left)
            visit node 
            walk(right)

    walk(root)


inorder(root):
    # return left, root, right

    stack = []

    while stack or root:
        if root:
             add root to stack 
             go left

        else:
            get node from stack 
            visit node 
            go right 


preorder(root):
    # return root, left, right

    stack = []

    while stack or root:
        if root:
            add root to stack 
            visit node 
            go left 

        else:
            get node from stack 
            go right

postorder(root):
    # return left, right, root 
    # visit in reverse 

    stack = []

    while stack or root:
        if root:
            add root to stack 
             visit node 
             go right 

        else:
            get node from stack 
            go left

    return reverse visited
```
