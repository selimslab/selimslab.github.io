  <p>‚ÄúThe brain is heavily influenced by genes. But from birth through young adulthood, the part of the human brain that most defines us (frontal cortex) is less a product of the genes with which you started life than of what life has thrown at you. Because it is the last to mature, by definition the frontal cortex is the brain region least constrained by genes and most sculpted by experience. This must be so, to be the supremely complex social species that we are. Ironically, it seems that the genetic program of human brain development has evolved to, as much as possible, free the frontal cortex from genes.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOn an incredibly simplistic level, you can think of depression as occurring when your cortex thinks an abstract thought and manages to convince the rest of the brain that this is as real as a physical stressor.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúGenes are rarely about inevitability, especially when it comes to humans, the brain, or behavior. They‚Äôre about vulnerability, propensities, tendencies.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMost people who do a lot of exercise, particularly in the form of competitive athletics, have unneurotic, extraverted, optimistic personalities to begin with. (Marathon runners are exceptions to this.)‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe live well enough to have the luxury to get ourselves sick with purely social, psychological stress.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy should people in one part of the globe have developed collectivist cultures, while others went individualist? The United States is the individualism poster child for at least two reasons. First there‚Äôs immigration. Currently, 12 percent of Americans are immigrants, another 12 percent are children of immigrants, and everyone else except for the 0.9 percent pure Native Americans descend from people who emigrated within the last five hundred years. And who were the immigrants? Those in the settled world who were cranks, malcontents, restless, heretical, black sheep, hyperactive, hypomanic, misanthropic, itchy, unconventional, yearning to be rich, yearning to be out of their damn boring repressive little hamlet, yearning. Couple that with the second reason - for the majority of its colonial and independent history, America has had a moving frontier luring those whose extreme prickly optimism made merely booking passage to the New World insufficiently novel - and you‚Äôve got America the individualistic.
Why has East Asia provided textbook examples of collectivism? The key is how culture is shaped by the way people traditionally made a living, which in turn is shaped by ecology. And in East Asia it‚Äôs all about rice. Rice, which was domesticated there roughly ten thousand years ago, requires massive amounts of communal work. Not just backbreaking planting and harvesting, which are done in rotation because the entire village is needed to harvest each family‚Äôs rice. The United States was not without labor-intensive agriculture historically. But rather than solving that with collectivism, it solved it withe slavery.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn other words, the default state is to trust, and what the amygdala does is learn vigilance and distrust.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúUltimately, forgiveness is usually about one thing‚Äî‚ÄùThis is for me, not for you.‚Äù Hatred is exhausting; forgiveness, or even just indifference, is freeing. To quote Booker T. Washington, ‚ÄúI shall allow no man to belittle my soul by making me hate him.‚Äù Belittle and distort and consume. Forgiveness seems to be at least somewhat good for your health‚Äîvictims who show spontaneous forgiveness, or who have gone through forgiveness therapy (as opposed to ‚Äúanger validation therapy‚Äù) show improvements in general health, cardiovascular function, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Chapter 14 explored how compassion readily, perhaps inevitably, contains elements of self-interest. The compassionate granting of forgiveness epitomizes this.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSecond, nothing about adolescence can be understood outside the context of delayed frontocortical maturation. If by adolescence limbic, autonomic, and endocrine systems are going full blast while the frontal cortex is still working out the assembly instructions, we‚Äôve just explained why adolescents are so frustrating, great, asinine, impulsive, inspiring, destructive, self-destructive, selfless, selfish, impossible, and world changing. Think about this‚Äîadolescence and early adulthood are the times when someone is most likely to kill, be killed, leave home forever, invent an art form, help overthrow a dictator, ethnically cleanse a village, devote themselves to the needy, become addicted, marry outside their group, transform physics, have hideous fashion taste, break their neck recreationally, commit their life to God, mug an old lady, or be convinced that all of history has converged to make this moment the most consequential, the most fraught with peril and promise, the most demanding that they get involved and make a difference. In other words, it‚Äôs the time of life of maximal risk taking, novelty seeking, and affiliation with peers. All because of that immature frontal cortex.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy is it that our automatic, intuitive moral judgments tend to be nonutilitarian? Because, as Greene states in his book, ‚ÄúOur moral brains evolved to help us spread our genes, not to maximize our collective happiness.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis brings up a key concept, namely the inverted U. The complete absence of stress is aversively boring. Moderate, transient stress is wonderful‚Äîvarious aspects of brain function are enhanced; glucocorticoid levels in that range enhance dopamine release; rats work at pressing levers in order to be infused with just the right amount of glucocorticoids. And as stress becomes more severe and prolonged, those good effects disappear (with, of course, dramatic individual differences as to where the transition from stress as stimulatory to overstimulatory occurs; one person‚Äôs nightmare is another‚Äôs hobby).‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúTestosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúA remarkably consistent finding, starting with elementary school students, is that males are better at math than females. While the difference is minor when it comes to considering average scores, there is a huge difference when it comes to math stars at the upper extreme of the distribution. For example, in 1983, for every girl scoring in the highest percentile in the math SAT, there were 11 boys.
Why the difference? There have always been suggestions that testosterone is central. During development, testosterone fuels the growth of a brain region involved in mathematical thinking and giving adults testosterone enhances their math skills. Oh, okay, it‚Äôs biological. But consider a paper published in science in 2008. The authors examined the relationship between math scores and sexual equality in 40 countries based on economic, educational and political indices of gender equality. The worst was Turkey, United States was middling, and naturally, the Scandinavians were tops. Low and behold, the more gender equal the country, the less of a discrepancy in math scores. By the time you get to the Scandinavian countries it‚Äôs statistically insignificant. And by the time you examine the most gender equal country on earth at the time, Iceland, girls are better at math than boys. Footnote, note that the other reliable sex difference in cognition, namely better reading performance by girls than by boys doesn‚Äôt disappear in more gender equal societies. It gets bigger. In other words, culture matters. We carry it with us wherever we go.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúEverything in physiology follows the rule that too much can be as bad as too little. There are optimal points of allostatic balance. For example, while a moderate amount of exercise generally increases bone mass, thirty-year-old athletes who run 40 to 50 miles a week can wind up with decalcified bones, decreased bone mass, increased risk of stress fractures and scoliosis (sideways curvature of the spine)‚Äîtheir skeletons look like those of seventy-year-olds. To put exercise in perspective, imagine this: sit with a group of hunter-gatherers from the African grasslands and explain to them that in our world we have so much food and so much free time that some of us run 26 miles in a day, simply for the sheer pleasure of it. They are likely to say, ‚ÄúAre you crazy? That‚Äôs stressful.‚Äù Throughout hominid history, if you‚Äôre running 26 miles in a day, you‚Äôre either very intent on eating someone or someone‚Äôs very intent on eating you.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Äúif you‚Äôre stressed like a normal mammal in an acute physical crisis, the stress response is lifesaving. But if instead you chronically activate the stress response for reasons of psychological stress, your health suffers.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe dissociation between fear and aggression is evident in violent psychopaths, who are the antithesis of fearful‚Äîboth physiologically and subjectively they are less reactive to pain; their amygdalae are relatively unresponsive to typical fear-evoking stimuli and are smaller than normal. This fits with the picture of psychopathic violence; it is not done in aroused reaction to provocation. Instead, it is purely instrumental, using others as a means to an end with emotionless, remorseless, reptilian indifference.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Äúpain makes aggressive people more aggressive, while doing the opposite to unaggressive individuals.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúArchaeologists do something impressive, reflecting disciplinary humility. When archaeologists excavate a site, they recognize that future archaeologists will be horrified at their primitive techniques, at the destructiveness of their excavating. Thus they often leave most of a site untouched to await their more skillful disciplinary descendants. For example, astonishingly, more than forty years after excavations began, less than 1 percent of the famed Qin dynasty terra-cotta army in China has been uncovered.‚Äù</p>
