title: Emergence and Chaos
---

Based on Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst by Sapolsky 

---

Basic building blocks follow a few simple rules,

This creates complex systems

---

Atoms

Organic molecules

Proteins 

Cells 

Microorganisms

Plants

Animals

Under a complexity threshold, there is convergence

For example, organic molecules converge to a finite number of possible stable states, proteins 

Plants and animals in a desert end up with a small set of strategies to survive

After passing a complexity threshold, a system enters into the land of chaos.   

A minor change can create enormous differences 

There is no ideal and optimal point to arrive,   

The only way is to wait and see.
