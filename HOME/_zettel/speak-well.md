Think before you speak

Emotions drive the conversation 

Have a positive, constructive attitude. 

Say something good or say nothing.

Style matters

Breath, voice, tone 

monolog vs dialog

---

Repeat the bottom line

Keep it short and sweet

The best story wins, not the best idea

---

Don't try to prove anything, 

people believe what they want to believe 

---

Sharing frequently organizes your thoughts
