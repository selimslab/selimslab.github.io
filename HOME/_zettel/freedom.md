A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, 

and in between he does what he wants to do. 

Bob Dylan

Freedom is to conquer your dark side, your anger, greed, pride, ..

A good life is to have time for yourself and your loved ones, to be your master

Everything can be taken from a man but one thing, the last of the human freedoms, 

to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, 

to choose one’s own way.

Viktor E. Frankl
