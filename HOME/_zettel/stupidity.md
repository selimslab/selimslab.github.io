Bad judgement 

Choosing an inappropriate model to interpret reality 

Either lacking the correct model, or not considering it even if you are aware

Being dumb is different from stupidity, its more like lacking the mental capacity 

Ignorance isnâ€™t stupidity. Smart or educated people can also be very stupid
