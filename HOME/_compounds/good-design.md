Good design resembles a likable person: respectful, generous and helpful.

Take hints from the past

Be mindful of emotions, soothe fears, use nostalgia, give hope

Get the specifications right

Do one thing and do it well 

“The best writing is rewriting.” 

Do today's work, tomorrow might turn out differently

divergence - convergence

Design for failure,

Make things work well even when things do not go as planned.
