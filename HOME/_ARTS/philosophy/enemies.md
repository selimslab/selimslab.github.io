"You have enemies? Good. That means youâ€™ve stood up for something, sometime in your life." 

They test us and make us stronger.

They exploit our flaws, motivating us to correct them.

They show us what we do not wish to become.

"The best revenge is not to be like your enemy" MA 

"Before you embark on journey of revenge, dig two graves" Confucius
