Do not regret mistakes, 

You need a lot of mistakes for a few good moves, 

a lot bad ideas for a few good ideas.

its not all your fault 

In the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret

---

Do not fear making mistakes, 

you are growing a mistake at a time

We blame ourselves but most things are so random

Suspicious of success, gentle on ourselves in failure

Much of what we get, we donâ€™t deserve
