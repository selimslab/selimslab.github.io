Seek wealth, not money or status. 

Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. 

Money is how we transfer time and wealth. 

Status is your place in the social hierarchy.

---

Ignore people playing status games. 

You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.

Play long term games with long term people.

Play iterated games 

---

Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

---

Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.

Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.

Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.

Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).

---

There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. 

Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.

---

Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.

---

If you want to live in the future, live in the freest place around. Because eventually, all of the innovators and creators will show up there.

---

An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.

When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day.
