<p class="img-alt">the logo is a zen circle and the greek letter Ξ (ξ, Xi)</p>

This is a software company I have started just after the university graduation, 

2 focus areas were:
1. less technical founders wishing to build a proof of concept or MVP to get feedback on their idea 
2. established startups wishing to go faster, and delegating a sub-system to another company is much faster than hiring engineers, and much more reliable than freelancers  

Designed and built proof of concepts, backend systems, data pipelines, ML and NLP models 

Most of the clients come through references, 

The scope and depth of the projects grew, and it made me flourish in gaining technical depth and maybe some business acumen  

Running a business has a lot of overhead and sometimes I felt like butter spread over too much bread -> [[mastery-comes-from-focus]] 

Discontinued after two years to pursue other opportunities, 

Starting a business is a great way to create value, it is much less comfortable yet more exciting 

I would be keen to start another business if I spot a suitable problem
