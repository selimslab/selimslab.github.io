This is a software company I have started just after the university graduation, 

Started by designing and building proof of concepts and minimum viable products for other startups, 

The scope and depth of the projects grew with as references bring new clients

Ended up doing this for two years, gained technical depth and judgement 

Yet correctly pricing, selling, executing, and delivering a product requires you spread your effort to many areas,
sometimes like butter spread over too much bread, and this is not good for [[programming-mastery]]
