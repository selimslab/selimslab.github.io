In toxic cultures, people get promoted for results even if they destroy relationships. Abuse is a price to pay for high performance.

In healthy cultures, no level of individual excellence justifies undermining people. Youâ€™re not a high performer if you don't elevate others.

-- Adam Grant 



If you see someone doing something positive and valuable, tell them you appreciate it. 

If you see someone doing something unethical, call them out.
