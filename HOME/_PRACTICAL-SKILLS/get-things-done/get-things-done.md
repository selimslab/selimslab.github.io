Start the day by working on your top goals 

If less than 2 mins, do it right away 

Batch work

Prepared, focused, short meetings

Define what you want because a weak definition means a bad outcome

Dare to say "I don't know"

If you're perfectly qualified to do something, you've already outgrown it

Half doing something is an expensive way of not doing it

Do it with all your heart

Think before you do, plan before you start.

Gain good habits 

Set clear goals, plan, create sytems  

Set up small checkpoints

Eliminate, simplify, chunk, breakdown, prioritize, delegate, focus, get feedback, iterate

Set a time bound, draw a deadline 

Focus on one thing at a time 

Prevent bad things before they happen 

Prioritize important over urgent

Ignore sunk costs 

Write down so you don't have to remember everything 

Make it one bit better

Prevent the worst 

Make work playful

Do not mix work and leisure. Have focused intervals of work and play 

Start small  

Stay professional, responsible and reliable. 

Everything looks like a failure in the middle, keep going
