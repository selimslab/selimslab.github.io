## Keyboard only 

A website should be usable without a mouse, only a keyboard, this is also halfway to make it screen-reader friendly 

Fortunately its easy when you use the standard web elements

Buttons and links with href are focusable, 

and one can navigate the page by just changing focus from the keyboard  

`Tab` on Chrome 

`Option + Tab` on Safari 

and `Enter` when you want to click 

Navigate and click 

## Visual 

Be mindful of color, contrast, and fonts 

## Inclusive 

Consider people with disabilities, people using screen readers, color blind people, people with poor vision, deaf people, ...   

Opt for bigger, cleaner, uncluttered elements 

Add descriptions to your images

## Use web standards 

Use standard HTML tags, buttons, links, onclicks, .. 

Convoluted things are not accessible 

## Navigation 

Make it clear where I am and where I can go from here 

Breadcrumbs are a good idea
