Maxwell's equations are a set of coupled partial differential equations 

They form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical optics, and electric circuits. 

The equations provide a mathematical model for electric, optical, and radio technologies, such as power generation, electric motors, wireless communication, lenses, radar etc. 

They describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges, currents, and changes of the fields
