We tend to do what is quick, easy, comfortable over doing the important 

We mistake the limits of our vision as the limits of the world 

Environment affects us more than we suspect

We fear what we don’t understand 

We jump to conclusions, judge, and oversimplify 

Emotions make decisions. Reason comes later and justifies.

We exaggerate

Familiar seems better, often it's not 

It won't be as good as you hope, neither as bad as you fear

Mistakes of others are easier to notice than our own 

We believe we are better than we actually are. 19% think they’re in the top 1% of earners, 95% of professors think they’re better than average

We can't read minds

We see what we want to see

We believe what we want to believe 

People like you more than you know 

People think about you way less than you believe
