The root of fear is a perceived threat, real or imaginary 

It is often fear under anxiety, anger, and hate 

Anger and hate inflame each other, and lead to suffering

When you face your fear, one of you will perish 

"Cast aside fear and regret, do the deed at hand"

"Fear both the heat and the cold of your heart, and try to have patience, if you can"
