##Â Public Key Cryptography

Public-key, or asymmetric cryptography, is a system that uses pairs of keys based on mathematical one-way functions 

If you use a single key, its symmetric cryptography

A key is a piece of information, usually a string of numbers or letters 

---

There are two keys, one public, one private, they are a pair 

Only the private key can decrypt a message which is encrypted with its public key 

And public key can verify if a message is signed with its private key 

eg.

1. Alice and Bob shares their public keys in the open, 

Bob 
1. writes a message to Alice
2. signs it with his private key
3. encrypts it using Alice's public key and 

Alice 
1. Gets the encrypted message
2. Opens it using her private key 
3. Verifies the signature using Bob's public key

## Authenticating public key owner


How do we know the public key really belongs to Alice? 

Anyone could come and claim they are Alice,

We need a mechanism to ensure that the public key really belongs to Alice  

## Certificates

In reality, you trust some entity, and it trusts others, so its turtles all the way down 

For example, imagine you visit a website claiming to be your bank, how can you trust it?

Your browser or operating system comes with pre-configured certificate authorities (CA), they are your root certificates

1. a website shares its public key with a CA 
2. CA verifies they are the bank indeed, and signs their public key 
3. the website hands you the certificate 
4. yet how do you trust this is signed by the CA indeed? someone else signed the CAs public key, too
5. you keep checking the certificates until you reach a trusted root certificate at the bottom 



## TLS

Transport layer security 

An improved and more secure version of SSL 

a standard communication method between processes is the socket

p1 -- socket -- p2 

TLS is a protocol to enable a socket to encrypt outgoing messages and decrypt the incoming


## Authentication 

1. Cryptographic keys
2. Passwords

Keys are more general, passwords are more specific 

For example a million users of a website can verify the site with a single certificate, 

and all users have their own passwords to authenticate 


## Authorization 

Yes they are authenticated now, yet what they are authorized to do? 

For example an OS sets different capabilities for different users 

Or a web app might have read/write permissions for each user 

Authorization levels helps managing the permissions
