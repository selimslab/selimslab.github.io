You plant the seeds and water them, 

you can’t force the growing

Build projects around motivated people

Remove obstacles

Provide the environment and support

and trust them to get it done.

The great ruler speaks little

and his words are priceless

He works without self-interest

and leaves no trace

When all is finished, the people say,

“It happened by itself"
