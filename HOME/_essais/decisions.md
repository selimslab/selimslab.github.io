We make even major decisions carelessly

a little forethought can prevent a lot of pain later.

Solve physical needs before deciding

Get some sleep 

Take a walk

Identify emotions 

Define goals, inputs, and deadline 

Create a process 

Go through it with people you respect

Consider second-order and third-order consequences. 

It is easier to stay out than get out.

Do not sell your future.

Never lie to yourself

“When there is doubt, there is no doubt.”

Make a move, don't stuck
