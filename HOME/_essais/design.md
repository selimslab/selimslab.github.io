Design for people,

for the way people behave,

not for how we would wish them to behave.

“Know thy user, and you are not thy user.” — Arnie Lund

Choose your audience 

Don’t design for everyone. It makes everyone unhappy. 


---

Good design resembles a likable person: respectful, generous and helpful.

Take hints from the past

Be mindful of emotions, soothe fears, use nostalgia, give hope 

---

Get the specifications right

Do one thing and do it well 

“The best writing is rewriting.” 

Do today's work, tomorrow might turn out differently

Test early 

“Testing one user early in the project is better than testing fifty near the end.” 


---

Good design is hard to notice because it blends into life 

> Design is like a mom, 
> 
> nobody notices when she’s around, 
> 
> but everybody misses her when she’s not.

---

Design for failure,

Make things work well even when things do not go as planned.

---

What makes something simple or complex?

It's not the number of dials or controls or how many features it has: 

It is whether the user has a good conceptual model of how it works

Its simple when there is nothing left to take away

a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds

---

Ship it

Usage is like oxygen for ideas.

You can’t make it better until you make it work.

“Release early. Release often.”

A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.
