title: Problem Solving

---

Prevention is the best

---

Don't panic

Start small

Sanity check

---

Go see the source

See examples 

Ask a lot of questions

Question assumptions

Take a break 

---

Symptoms vs root cause

State the problem clearly

Test hypotheses

---

Take a walk

Get some sleep 

Take a shower 

Speak with a friend

---

Grinding your wheels won't solve your problem

Give your mind some space
