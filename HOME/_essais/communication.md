Be present, be interested

If you are not interested, walk away.

---

Set aside your opinion

Listen with a beginner’s mind.

Suspend judgement, it’s not personal, not about you 

---

Listen to understand, not to answer.

Do not offer solutions, just listen.

Listen to what isn't being said, too 

---

Think before you speak

---

Emotions drive the conversation 

Have a positive, constructive attitude. 

Say something good or say nothing.

---

Style matters

Breath, voice, tone 

monolog vs dialog

---

Repeat the bottom line

Keep it short and sweet 

---

People can't read your mind, 

something being obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to them 

---

The best story wins, not the best idea

---

Don't try to prove anything, 

people believe what they want to believe 

---

Sharing frequently organizes your thoughts
