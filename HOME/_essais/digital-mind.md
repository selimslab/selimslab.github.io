title: Building a digital mind
---

A space to organize thoughts 

A place of your own

Not some BigCo walled garden  

---

Ideas, pictures, drawings, papers, blog posts, little notes, drafts

Ideas spark each other 

---

Remember, reuse, reorg 

Simplify and organize 

---

Give your mind some space
