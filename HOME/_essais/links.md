[The Essence of Information - Matthias Endler](https://endler.dev/2017/the-essence-of-information/)

History tends to repeat itself as soon as the lessons of events slip from the living memory. 

Companies are AIs, humans are their replacable cells. Like paperclip maximizers, they work to maximize revenue disregarding the cost on society, human happiness, and environment
