**Pride**, thinking you are better than others, for no good reason, snobbishness, belittling people

**Wrath**, unnecessary excessive anger

**Greed**, graves have nothing in them, you have nothing to lose

**Envy**, be content with what you have, want all, lose all 

**Lust**, sex is good but its not above your character, integrity, or peace of mind

**Sloth**, laziness, reluctance to work
