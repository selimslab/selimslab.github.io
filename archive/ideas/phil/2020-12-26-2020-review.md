discard anger

discard anxiety

neither blame others nor yourself 

do what is in your control, stop worrying for what is not 

in the long term, habits rule

don't do anything reluctantly 

the answer is no 

get out earlier 

value your time and attention 

you can make it better 

make it one bit better, keep walking
