## Plato

Love is education, it is to grow together. Complementary qualities, strength in different aspects. 

Art is propaganda. Beautiful objects encourage us to be like them. Ugliness is dangerous, it pushes us to be ugly too. So we need cencorship, art could lead to better but also to worse. 

How can a society have eudaimonia? Better childhoods, better role models, courage, self-control, reasonableness, independence, and calm

## Epicurus

Lived on bread, olive, and cheese and he had two cloaks.  

We don't need money, romance, or luxury.  What we really want is calm, understanding, respect, appreciation.  

Friendships are so rewarding. 


## Aristotle

**golden mean,** Moral goodness is a habit. Takes time and practice.  

**friendship**, A true friend is someone who you care as much as yourself. Their joy is yours and their sorrow too 

**art**, the task of art is to make truth stick. Tragedy reminds terrible things can happen to us all so we shouldn't judge people. a change in fortune, a moment of dramatic revelation, catharsis

**persuasion** 

* Leverage emotions, soothe fears, feed hopes
* Use visuals, examples, facts, stats, without getting boring 
* Make it short and funny


## Stoics

very little is needed to make a happy life 

Anxiety is the gap between fear and hope. When you face your fear, it vanishes 

To reduce worry, assume the worst. expect everything, dress rehersal for catastrophe

Anger is the collision of hope and reality. Something has to be both sad and unexpected to cause anger. If you expect anything, nothing makes you much angry

We blame ourselves but most things are so random. Be suspicious of success and gentle on ourselves in failure. Much of what we get, we don't deserve 

Astronomy is humbling and corrects the perspective
