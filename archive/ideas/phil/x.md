## How to get things done?

**Be strategic**, Think before you do, plan before you start. Why do you want to do it? Is this the right thing to do? Productivity in the wrong direction is just wasted energy. 

**Do what you love**, love what you do. 

**Work smart**, goal, plan, system, habit. 

Eliminate, simplify, chunk, breakdown

Prioritize, delegate, focus, feedback, iterate

**Set a time bound**, If you don't have a deadline, makeup one  

**Focus**, work on one thing 

**Pre-mortems**, prevent bad things before they happen 

**Prioritize**, important over urgent, ignore sunk costs 

**Write down**, so you don't have to remember everything 

**One bit better**, Make it one bit better, prevent the worst 

**Make work playful**, but do not mix work and leisure. Focused intervals. 

**Start small**, simple to complex 

**Park downhill**, stop work with a cliffhanger, so it's easier to start again. Save some easy tasks for low motivation periods 

**Professional** means responsible and reliable. 

**Keep walking**, Everything looks like a failure in the middle, keep going 

## On decision making

Take your time, analyze, sanity check, cross-check, and make a move, don't stuck.

If a decision is reversible, act quickly. Most decisions are reversible and we regret the chances we didn't take. 

Be mindful of how you feel and why.

Prevention is the best fix. It is easier to stay out than get out.

Consider second-order and third-order consequences. 

Do not sell your future. 

Never lie to yourself.

Go through a process with people you respect

No by default, if you can't decide, the answer is no
