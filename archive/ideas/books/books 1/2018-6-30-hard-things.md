move on with the misery and focus on solution 

hire for strength rather than lack of weaknesses 

make the effort to know someone or something or don't assume you know them 

over-confidence is enemy of competence. be aware of your weaknesses 

define what you want because a weak definition means a bad outcome 

focus on what you need to get right and stop worrying for other things
