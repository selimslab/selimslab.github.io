2/3s of the world turning to deserts. Bare soil cannot hold carbon and water 

4 months rain, 8 months dry, if the grass is not gone before the next rain, its very bad. Burning grass leaves the soil bare, not a solution. 

The solution is livestock. Grazing animals prevents desertification. 

If we reverse the desertification for half the worlds grasslands, we will be back to preindustrial CO2 levels
