## critic

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

Do what you feel in your heart to be right – for you’ll be criticized anyway.

"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.


## mistakes 

Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.

If you are making mistakes...you're Doing Something.

Learn from the mistakes of others. You can never live long enough to make them all yourself.

Make your mistakes, take your chances, look silly, but keep on going. Don’t freeze up.

walk slow but walk 

Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.


## ignorance

Confidence is ignorance. If you're feeling cocky, it's because there's something you don't know.

All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence; then success is sure.

Education: the path from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty.



## time 

It’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.

All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.

All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.

Don’t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.

A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.

Time is the longest distance between two places.

Look at everything always as though you were seeing it either for the first or last time: Thus is your time on earth filled with glory.

What is the point of being alive if you don't at least try to do something remarkable?

Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?

Spring is the time of plans and projects.

It is not the length of life, but the depth.

if you don’t spend your life yourself, other people spend it for you.



## create 

Lack of direction, not lack of time, is the problem.

Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create.

In a time of destruction, create something.

Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.



## think 

The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven..


There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.

The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.

If everyone is thinking the same, then no one is thinking

Whenever you think or you believe or you know, you're a lot of other people: but the moment you feel, you're nobody-but-yourself.

Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.

Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.

## act 


A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for.

Who is happier, who has braved the storm of life and lived or who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?

Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but of playing a poor hand well.

A random act of kindness


Do not go gentle into that good night.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good.

Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us.

Like all magnificent things, it's very simple.

Everything must be made as simple as possible. But not simpler.


Nothing great in the world was accomplished without passion. Do it for love. 


Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart.

If you are going through hell, keep going.

You have nothing to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.


mindful, grateful, positive 

Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.

Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle.

What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?


What you seek is seeking you. Ask for what you want and be prepared to get it!


It begins a single step. Stop waiting, start doing.


Life is to be enjoyed, not endured

How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.

Live to the point of tears.

My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, or else my heart concealing it will break.

These violent delights have violent ends

I am free and that is why I am lost.

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

I've found that there is always some beauty left -- in nature, sunshine, freedom, in yourself; these can all help you.


You will do foolish things, but do them with enthusiasm.
