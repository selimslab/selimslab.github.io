I am Selim, yet another human on the pale blue dot 

Interested in arts, STEM, social sciences, practical skills, and outdoor sports 

Writing shows me how little I know about the topic, and brings clarity, also see [[digital-mind]]

The name of the site comes from the greek letter Î”(delta), symbol of change in math  

Would be happy to meet you -> durufikir at gmail dot com
