I am Selim, yet another human on the pale blue dot 

Writing shows me how little I know about the topic and brings clarity

The name of this website comes from the greek letter Δ (δ, delta), the symbol of change in math  

I have omitted the authors of some quotes because it's easy to find on the internet, and I am more interested in the content rather than who says it
