I am Selim, writing here to examine ideas, connect them in novel ways, remember those worth remembering, and apply 

Application is key here, you create value when you apply an idea. For example using a psychology concept for problem solving or using a philosophical principle for decision making

I have omitted the authors most of the time since I am more interested in the content rather than who says it, and its easy to find the source on the internet
