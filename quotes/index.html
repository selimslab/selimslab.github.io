You’re going to miss life. You’ve got to jump off the cliff all the time and build your wings on the way down.”
― Ray Bradbury</p>

― Steve Jobs</p>

<p>“If you treat an individual as he is, he will remain how he is. But if you treat him as if he were what he ought to be and could be, he will become what he ought to be and could be.”</p>

<p>If there is a God, He will have to beg my forgiveness.</p>

<p>Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires</p>

<p>Beware of overconcern for money, or position, or glory. Someday you will meet a man who cares for none of these things. Then you will know how poor you are.</p>

<p>Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.</p>

<p>Pursue a path you can walk with love and reverence</p>

<p>How does it help.. to make troubles heavier by bemoaning them?</p>

<p>We suffer more in imagination than in reality</p>

<p>Don’t explain your philosophy, embody it</p>

<p>Words are loaded pistols</p>

<p>Circumstances reveal the man</p>
