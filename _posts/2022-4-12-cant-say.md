title: What can't you say?
---




What are people afraid to talk about, what is forbidden, what are taboos?

What can't you say? 

If nothing, is it a coincidence?

---

question assumptions

watch your own thoughts from a distance

---

start asking, could this be true?

what groups are powerful but nervous?

people get mad when they believe it might be true

---

draw a sharp line between your thoughts and your speech.

pensieri stretti, viso sciolto

an open face and closed thoughts

So who do you tell? Whoever needed and no more
