I shall be telling this with a sigh

Somewhere ages and ages hence:

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—

I took the one less traveled by,

And that has made all the difference.

― Robert Frost 
  
  
> “The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.”
― William Shakespeare

A little forethought can prevent a lot of pain later.

Make a move. Don’t overanalyze everything.

Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason

second and third order consequences

you miss 100% of the shots you don't take

It is easier to stay out than get out.

Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.

The perfect moment is NOW

hope is not a strategy

In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.

do not sell your future

Don’t spend a dollar’s worth of time on a ten cent decision.

go through a process with people you respect

NEVER lie to yourself.

Fail. But do it quickly and learn a lesson.

cross check

sanity check

NO: Learn to say No.

you get what you measure

don't make hasty decisions.

It’s easy to mistake excitement for passion, motivation and ability.

Face Your Problems: Don't delay.

There's no such thing as a purely rational decision. 

There are no silver bullets; there are no shortcuts.
