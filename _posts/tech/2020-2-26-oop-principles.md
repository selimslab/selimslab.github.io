# Abstraction
boxes inside boxes 

# Encapsulation
Hide data and selectively reveal

# Inheritance 
Create parent child relationships 

Creates an "is-a" relationship. 

For example if Mars inherits from a Planet, Mars <b>is a</b> planet 

# Polymorphism 
Means many shapes, makes it easy to adapt

Many different classes could have a method with the same name but with a different implementation. 
With polymorphism, every class will execute its correct method. 
 
Polymorphism could be static or dynamic 
Method overloading is used for static polymorphism.
Inheritance + method overriding is used for dynamic polymorphism.
