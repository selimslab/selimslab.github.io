## Questions to Ask Yourself

-Is it a discrete chunk of work?

-Does the person have the skills to do the work?

-Does the person have the authority to be successful?

-Does the person have the tools necessary to be 
successful?

-Does the person know what the result should look like?

-Does the person know when the work is due?

-Do you know how often you want this person to report on progress?

-Does this person know what progress looks like?

## Product Press release 

Amazon approach 

thinking of a press release before working on a product 

Here's an example outline for the press release

* Heading - Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
* Sub-Heading - Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
* Summary - Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
* Problem - Describe the problem your product solves.
* Solution - Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
* Quote from You - A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
* How to Get Started - Describe how easy it is to get started.
* Customer Quote - Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
* Closing and Call to Action - Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
