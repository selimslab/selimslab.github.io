it makes the life worth living 

love is truly wanting someone to be well and happy, even more than yourself 

it is loving despite the shortcomings of your lover

love is growing together, making each other better

love is education

love is patience

love is loyalty

love is dangerous, it can make and break you 

That's what careless words do. They make people love you a little less.

love, affection, attention are good when they happen naturally. chasing them is in vain

love is precious, if you love, don't let it go

love is fragile, so be careful 

love is complex, as life

The course of true love never did run smooth.

Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.

It is a curious thought, but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them.

The more one judges, the less one loves.

what a luxury it was for people to hold their loved ones whenever they wanted

someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.


Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.

The very essence of romance is uncertainty.

You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection

I'd rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I am not.

Who, being loved, is poor?

Tis better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all.
