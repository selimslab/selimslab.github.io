Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.


## critic

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

Do what you feel in your heart to be right – for you’ll be criticized anyway.

"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.


## mistakes 

Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.

if you are making mistakes...you're Doing Something.

Learn from the mistakes of others. You can never live long enough to make them all yourself.

Make your mistakes, take your chances, look silly, but keep on going. Don’t freeze up.

walk slow but walk 


## ignorance

Confidence is ignorance. If you're feeling cocky, it's because there's something you don't know.

All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence; then success is sure.

Education: the path from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty.



## time 

It’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.

All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.

All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.

Don’t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.

A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.

Time is the longest distance between two places.

Look at everything always as though you were seeing it either for the first or last time: Thus is your time on earth filled with glory.

What is the point of being alive if you don't at least try to do something remarkable?

Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?

Spring is the time of plans and projects.

It is not the length of life, but the depth.


## move on 

That is why it is so important to let certain things go. To release them. To cut loose. People need to understand that no one is playing with marked cards; sometimes we win and sometimes we lose. Don't expect to get anything back, don't expect recognition for your efforts, don't expect your genius to be discovered or your love to be understood. Complete the circle. Not out of pride, inability or arrogance, but simply because whatever it is no longer fits in your life. Close the door, change the record, clean the house, get rid of the dust. Stop being who you were and become who you are.

You must make a decision that you are going to move on. It wont happen automatically. You will have to rise up and say, ‘I don’t care how hard this is, I don’t care how disappointed I am, I’m not going to let this get the best of me. I’m moving on with my life.

It is so hard to leave—until you leave. And then it is the easiest goddamned thing in the world


## daily 

May you live every day of your life.

The trouble is if you don’t spend your life yourself, other people spend it for you.

One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable words.

Get busy living or get busy dying.






## create 

Lack of direction, not lack of time, is the problem.

Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create.

In a time of destruction, create something.

Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.





## think 

The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven..


There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.

The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.

If everyone is thinking the same, then no one is thinking

Whenever you think or you believe or you know, you're a lot of other people: but the moment you feel, you're nobody-but-yourself.

Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.

Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.

## act 

The future depends on what you do today.

A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for.

who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?

Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but of playing a poor hand well.


A random act of kindness, no matter how small, can make a tremendous impact on someone else's life.

sometimes you don't need a goal in life, you don't need to know the big picture. you just need to know what you're going to do next!

Life is like a prism. What you see depends on how you turn the glass.


Do what is right, not what is easy nor what is popular.

The secret of life is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.

If you don't go after what you want, you'll never have it. If you don't ask, the answer is always no. If you don't step forward, you're always in the same place.

Courage isn't having the strength to go on - it is going on when you don't have strength.


Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.


## perfect

If you look for perfection, you'll never be content.

And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good.




Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us.

Like all magnificent things, it's very simple.

Everything must be made as simple as possible. But not simpler.


## passion 

Nothing great in the world was accomplished without passion.

You can only become truly accomplished at something you love. Don’t make money your goal. Instead pursue the things you love doing and then do them so well that people can’t take their eyes off of you.

Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart.

If you are going through hell, keep going.

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.


## be kind 

Be mindful. Be grateful. Be positive. Be true. Be kind.

Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.

Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle.

What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?


## ask 

Ask for what you want and be prepared to get it!

What you seek is seeking you.


## start 

The scariest moment is always just before you start.

The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.

you can, you should, and if you’re brave enough to start, you will.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.


## live 

Life is to be enjoyed, not endured

How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.

Live to the point of tears.

My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, or else my heart concealing it will break.

These violent delights have violent ends


## freedom

I am free and that is why I am lost.

Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

I've found that there is always some beauty left -- in nature, sunshine, freedom, in yourself; these can all help you.

They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.


## iterate

The first draft of anything is shit.

You will do foolish things, but do them with enthusiasm.

Everybody talks about wanting to change things and help and fix, but ultimately all you can do is fix yourself. And that's a lot. Because if you can fix yourself, it has a ripple effect.
