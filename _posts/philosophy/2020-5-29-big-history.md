## The Future 

in at most 1b years, life on earth will end

in 4b years sun will die  

in 100b years most stars will die 

at some point, all stars and even black holes will die

heat death, end of universe 

in the grand scheme of things, our lives are a brief glimpse of light 

so petty are ideologies, nations, religions, money,  power, pleasure, pain.. 

if you think of all time as a year, jan 1st is big bang, and every second would be 431 years

humans appeared in the last minutes of the year, and our lives are just miliseconds

life is brief, enjoy it
