forecast victory:

discipline 

highly trained

talented generals 

ceza ve ödülde kesinlik ve tutarlılık 

who is in harmony with his team 

<br>

warfare is deception 

able to attack -> seem unable 

using force -> seem inactive 

are you near -> seem far 

far -> seem near 

stronger enemy? -> evade him 

kızıyor mu -> irritate him 

pretend to be weak -> they grow arrogant 

is enemy united -> separate them 

attack when enemy is not expecting 

plan before the battle

wishing to fight -> count the cost 

haste is stupid but long delays are not clever either

savaşı kısa kes 

great object is victory -> not lengthy campaigns

the best is winning without fighting 

if you can't control your anger -> you lose 

give obeyable orders

use right man in right place 

1. know when to fight and when not to fight 

2. know to handle both superior and inferior enemies

3. everyone in team should share the goal 

4. be prepared and wait to take them unprepared

5. general should be autonom in military decisions


know the enemy 

know yourself 

first eliminate the risk of defeat, than look for victory 

to secure ourselves is in our hands -> but enemy provides the opportunity to be defeated

not only win, but win with ease 

if you only see the obvious -> you win by diffuculty 

if you look below the surface -> you win with ease 

look under, ask why 

don't make your enemy desparate, leave an outlet 

recklessness, cowardice, haste, fazla gurur, fazla merhamet -> defeat 

Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.

Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.
