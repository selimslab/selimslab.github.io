Power is two sided, it can be used for good or evil 

The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.

“Whoever is winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible.” - George Orwell

Soft power is shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction, rather than coercing (contrast hard power)
