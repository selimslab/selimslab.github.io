ask questions, make a dialoge not monolog 

plan what you want to say and refine it 

try to understand needs, interests, capabilities, fears, wishes, ... of others

is it a good time to talk about?

always respond to emails

keep people informed

know your audience, choose the time, listen 

estimate -> "I will get back to you"

don't rely heavily on anything 

maybe keep a log of your estimates

geçmişi bilmeyen tekrar eder 

choose good tools and know them well

kendini kandırma

debug -> rubber duck + visualize+ eliminate + trace + ask why 

common sense and plain dealing 

At the beginning -> define requirements well 

under promise, over deliver 

do not make promises
