<b>Sprints:</b> Build software incrementally and iteratively. Deliver working features so you can get customer feedback early and often.

<b>User Stories:</b> Write down ideas to work on and prioritize them. Defer figuring out the details (when this is responsible) because youâ€™ll know more later.

<b>Scrum Meetings:</b> Regularly talk as a team about what is going on.

<b>Reviews:</b> Regularly show people what you are building to get feedback.

<b>Retros:</b> Regularly discuss how you can work better as a team.

<b>Product Owner:</b> Have someone who has the knowledge, authority, and availability to prioritize features.

<b>Scrum Master:</b> Have someone focused on process improvement and coordination. This person should ask questions and employ coaching. They should not give orders.
