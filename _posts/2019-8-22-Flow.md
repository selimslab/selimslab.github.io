Deeply absorbed in an activity and at one with the task.

There’s general agreement within positive psychology that we’re at our most happy when in ‘flow’.

This is distinct from pleasure which feels raw and we know it’s happening.

Playing an instrument, reading, painting, coding, sports..

Awaken and notice the beautiful result in your hands.
This is flow. This is happiness.

> Crystallized ideas. Pure brainpower alive.

The flow is possible without consciously trying but 3 simple steps can make it easier to achieve.

**1. Have a clear and challenging goals.**

It helps when both the challenge and your skill level is higher.

**2. Satisfy physical needs.**

Eat, sleep, find a comfy place.

**3. Remove distractions.**

Clean the desk, get the phone out of your sight.

When we can make more time in our lives to intensely concentrate on meaningful tasks, especially when they draw on our signature strengths, then we can truly improve and sustain our happiness.
