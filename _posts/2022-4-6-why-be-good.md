title:  Why do good?   
---

Nothing is yours, 

Material things, loved ones, not even your body,

Only your actions. 

<br>

You are what you do.

<br>

Most of what you get in life, you don't deserve 

Yet you deserve what kind of person you become, it is your choice 

<br>

What is a better reward than to be a person of character? 

What is a worse punishment than degrading and corrupting your heart, one act at a time?
