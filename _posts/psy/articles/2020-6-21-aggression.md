[This could be why you're depressed or anxious - Johann Hari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB5IX-np5fE)

All feelings are imperfect signals about met/unmet needs. 

If you feel anxious or depressed, you are not crazy, not a broken machine, you are just a human being with unmet needs.

Pain, fear, depression, frustration, anger, disappointment, grief.. they are all helpful and necessary signals

The way is to collaborate with emotions and use them as clues, constructive criticism to improve our lives. It is a habit and we need consistent practice to gain this habit.
