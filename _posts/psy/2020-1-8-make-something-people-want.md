people wanted to share photos, save ideas, write reviews, send messages, to be aware of the world

they still want them

only the means are changing

focus on the things that do not change

## Not-so-shocking facts 

• Almost everyone fears rejection
• People are not as satisfied as they could be
• Most people have a low/moderate self esteem.
• People want decisions that make them look good
• 2/3 of women and 1/3 of men dislike the way they look
• Almost everyone works to avoid pain
• People don’t have time to comparison shop
• When their mind is set on something, they want it now
• Almost everyone is afraid to grow old, fears death


People have archaic, subconscious, instinctive desires.

These desires are continually re-shaped by social, economical and technological forces.

Live in the future and look back


## Market = mass demand

Mass Desire can not be created, it can only be channeled and exploited.

Mass Desire is the wave we want to ride

People want what others want at surface levels

People want same things at the deepest level

Make something people want

## Remove steps
Make it possible for more people
Make it possible in more situations


` Startup Outcome = Skill x Determination x Luck `

Start small and grow like an onion

## problem 
Solve a problem for few users who want a solution a lot

worthy problems are usually
1. Hard
2. Schleppy
3. Unsexy
4. Frequent
5. Urgent


> When you first solve a problem, you
come up with something very
complex, and most people stop there.
If you keep living with the problem
you arrive at very elegant and simple
solutions
Steve Jobs

## Work or Play

What seems like work to other people that doesn't seem like work to you?

Dont look for ideas, just work on things that you find genuinely interesting 

## do one thing, and do it well 
No great company I know of started doing multiple things at once—they start with a lot of conviction about one thing, and see it all the way through. 

You can do far fewer things than you think. 

Show. Do not tell.

## “product”

By the way, “product” includes all interactions a user has with the company.

very often the real reason is that the product just isn’t good enough.
