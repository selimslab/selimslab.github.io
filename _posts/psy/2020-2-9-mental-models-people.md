## being vulnerable vs insecurity
Vulnerable: exposed, wide open, susceptible to getting hurt.

Insecure: afraid, filled with doubt, not confident.

It takes courage and confidence to allow yourself to be vulnerable.

The more you admit your faults and shortcomings, the more people will like you. 
Being able to admit when you're wrong is a wonderfully attractive quality and gets you a lot of legitimacy. It's endearing.
