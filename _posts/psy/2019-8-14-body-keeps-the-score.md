Traumatic stress is a kind of being absent from the present time.

To know our feelings is the first step to understanding its sources.

The first step of healing is perceiving, defining and naming what is happening in our inner world.

Being aware of the changes in our inner and outer world 

the balance between the rational and emotional brain 

Mindfulness 

Neuroscience studies show that the only way to change our feelings is to
recognize inner experiences and become close friends with what is going inside.

Watching out bodiesâ€™ senses brings us to gain control over them. 

Realizing anger, tension and anxiety help to change your perspective and offer new options instead of reacting impulsively.

Breaking the silence by disclosing your secrets instead of suppressing emotions gives you freedom.
