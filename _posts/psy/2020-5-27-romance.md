## on adultery 

All you love and wanted is sacrificed for a few orgasms with a woman you did not even love.

Don’t make this mistake because the consequences are life long and affecting your loved ones as well. 

## Divorce

from a quora answer -> Divorce happened because I married a person who was in effect a stranger and every bit I did not know about him I filled in with my imagination.

## choose wisely

you = your spouse 

your partner is half of your life. they affect your work, friends, social status, interests, ..

marry not only someone you love but also someone who is loving you, too. 

choose him/her wisely
