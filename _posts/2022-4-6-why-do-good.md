title:  Why do good?   
---


The short answer is, do good for your own good. 

But why? and how? 

<br>

Nothing is yours, 

Material things, loved ones, not even your body,

Only your actions. 

<br>

You are what you do.

<br>

Most of what you get in life, you don't deserve 

Yet you deserve what kind of person you become, it is your choice 

You pay for what you do by becoming the person you are 

<br>


What is a worse punishment than degrading and corrupting your heart, one act at a time? 

Would you be willing to compromise your integrity, your heart, and peace of mind for some mortal gain?

Nasty people are neither healthy nor happy. And thatâ€™s probably a fair price

What is a better reward than to be a person of character? And we can be. 

We can change our worst sides. We are able to change for the better.
