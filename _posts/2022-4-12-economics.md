Current economic models views growth as a must, at the expense of people

Current world order makes the rich richer, makes the poor even poorer

No natural and healthy system has to grow indefinitely to stay alive. 

Yet the world economy is neither natural nor healthy. 

Thus it has to continue polluting, 

not giving a fuck about children dying from preventable diseases, 

from lack of a $1 mosquito net or $2 vaccine, 

making millions of animals miserable in meat and milk industries, 

filling the ocean with plastic,

by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish

What for? to make the rich richer

Economics is not neat supply-demand curves. It is a system with feedback loops, and the loops are either balancing or reinforcing. 

Healthy systems has balancing feedback loops, like your body temperature, or the water cycle in nature. Reinforcing loops wreak havoc, like aggression causing more aggression, hate causing more hate, greed causing more greed. 

Countries are not poor because their people are lazy; their people are ‘lazy’ because they are poor
