Bad judgement 

Choosing an inappropriate model to interpret reality 

Either lacking the correct model, or not considering it even if you are aware

Being dumb is different from stupidity, its more like lacking the mental capacity 

Ignorance isnâ€™t stupidity. Smart or educated people can also be very stupid

In translation from Aristotle's Ethics 

To folly it belongs to judge things badly, 

to deliberate badly, 

to be bad in social intercourse, 

to use badly present goods, 

to think erroneously about what is good and noble as regards life. 

Folly is accompanied by ignorance, inexperience, incontinence, tactlessness, shortness of memory.
