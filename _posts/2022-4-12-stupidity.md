The two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity.

This life’s hard, but it’s harder if you’re stupid.

    To folly it belongs to judge things badly, 
    to deliberate badly, 
    to be bad in social intercourse, 
    to use badly present goods, 
    to think erroneously about what is good and noble as regards life. 

Folly is accompanied by ignorance, inexperience, incontinence, tactlessness, shortness of memory. 

It is better to offer no excuse than a bad one.

Talk sense to a fool and he calls you foolish.

It is better to remain silent at the risk of being thought a fool, than to talk and remove all doubt of it.


## Ignorance

Ignorance isn’t stupidity

Confidence is ignorance. If you're feeling cocky, it's because there's something you don't know.

All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence; then success is sure.

Education: the path from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty.
