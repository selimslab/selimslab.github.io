Life is not short but we waste it. 

Do what you can now and here   

Material gains come through great toil, and kept by great anxiety. 

Good character and experiences, nothing can take it from you. 

The whole wisdom and beauty of the world is here to be explored and to expand your life beyond your time. 

A good life is to have time for yourself and your loved ones, to be your master
