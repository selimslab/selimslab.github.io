title: How to be unhappy?
---


 
Comparison 

Illusion of control

All or nothing 

Expectation 

Negativity 

Black filter 

Ignoring positives

Jumping to conclusions 

Mind reading 

Exaggeration 

Should would sentences

Labelling

Wrong intuitions 

Taking it personal 

Hedonic adaptation 

Unfit mental models


---

It’s not personal 

It’s not all up to you 

It doesn’t matter 

It will be better

---

The unhappiest people in this world, are those who care the most about what other people think.

Life is too short to waste your time on people who don’t respect, appreciate, and value you.

Our intuitions are wrong 

we think relatively 

we get used to it

Impact bias, We think it will last longer and be more impactful. This bias is worse for bad events 

True love, marriage, perfect body, good job, lots of money, all adapted, not true happiness 

Experiences make us happier than material things. Happiness from an experience lasts longer. Material things are the worst kind of hedonic adaptation. 

Savoring, mindfulness, feeling the moment , living in the moment 

Gratitude 

Thinking as the last day 

negative things that could happen
