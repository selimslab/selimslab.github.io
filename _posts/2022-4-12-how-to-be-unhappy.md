title: How to be unhappy?
---


 
Comparison 

Illusion of control

All or nothing 

Expectation 

Negativity 

Black filter 

Ignoring positives

Jumping to conclusions 

Mind reading 

Exaggeration 

Should would sentences

Labelling

Wrong intuitions 

Taking it personal 

Hedonic adaptation 

Unfit mental models


---

It’s not personal 

It’s not all up to you 

It doesn’t matter 

It will be better

The unhappiest people in this world, are those who care the most about what other people think.

Life is too short to waste your time on people who don’t respect, appreciate, and value you.
