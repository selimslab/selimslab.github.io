If you want to understand a behaviour, 

you should consider multiple levels of causality,

from the second before to millions of years before 

---

An example case:

There is man running toward you and holds something that looks like a gun. You shot him 

**1 sec before**

 amygdala -> fear, excitement 

**Minutes before**

if you are hungry or tired, frontal cortex doesn’t work well and ask you that are you sure if it is a gun  

**Hours to days**

testesteron, stress hormones, alcohol 

they are not the cause but they amplify existing tendencies 

**Weeks to months**

 neuroplasticity -> brain changes by experience, if previous months were stressful, amygdala will enlarge, and will be harder to control 

**Years to decades**

adolescence shapes the brain , stress in childhood or as a fetus leads to larger amygdala and elevated stress hormone levels

Genes don’t determine anything because they work differently in different environments. Genes and environment interact 

**Centuries** 

if ancestors are nomadic herders, mood are that they will have a culture of honor and quick to anger and revenge, 

and this values can stick around for centuries 

Millions of years -> evolution, some species have lower aggression levels some higher 

---

Its complicated and be careful to conclude what causes a behavior, 

especially if it’s a one you are judging harshly 

---

Context matters 

We don’t hate violence, we love it in the right context 

Pulling a trigger or touching someone has very different meanings in different contexts

---

Every bits of biology can change and it is possible to change in a good way 

Ecosystems change -> Sahara was a lush grassland 

Brains change 

Cultures change  

<br>

People can get better 

even the ones who have done bad things 

<br>

We can change our worst sides,

History is full of such examples 

We are able to change for the better.
