title: How to write better?
---

For better writing, eliminate, simplify, clarify, and choose your words well

What to write down? 

Don't copy paste, paraphrase, think for yourself 

Instead of arbitrary goals, have some questions and set out to answer them

How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.
