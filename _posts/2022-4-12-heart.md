Heart is a compass

Whatever you do, do it with all your heart 

“Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart.” 
― Confucius

Whenever you think or you believe or you know, you're a lot of other people: but the moment you feel, you're nobody-but-yourself.

Nothing great in the world was accomplished without passion. Do it for love. 

My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, or else my heart concealing it will break.

If you are going through hell, keep going.

You will do foolish things, but do them with enthusiasm.

To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.

Blessed are the hearts that can bend; they shall never be broken.

"If we listened to our intellect we'd never have a love affair. We'd never have a friendship. We'd never go in business because we'd be cynical: "It's gonna go wrong." Or "She's going to hurt me." Or,"I've had a couple of bad love affairs, so therefore . . ." Well, that's nonsense. You're going to miss life. You've got to jump off the cliff all the time and build your wings on the way down."
