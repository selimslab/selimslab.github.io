**noise -> signal -> story -> decision -> reality**

you simplify, generalize, reduce, stereotype. 

you are irrational and you jump to conclusions.

you find stories and patterns even in sparse data. 

you imagine familiar things as better

you think you know what others are thinking but you don't

you project your current mindset onto the past and future

you favor the immediate over delayed, close over distant, quick and simple over complicated and important 

you tend to keep up status quo to avoid mistakes and preserve status 

you notice the details that confirm your existing beliefs. 

you notice what is new, different, unexpected, repeated often, or primed in memory 

you edit and reinforce some memories after the fact. 

environment has a large impact on your actions.

you notice flaws in others more easily than flaws in yourself.

We are bad at judging probabilities.

Life is uncertain and luck plays a big role  

First information acts as an anchor 

A third decoy option can help choosing 

Rhyming sentences seem truer 

People hear and accept ideas aligning with their existing beliefs 
  
Fear of losing is stronger than hope of winning 

We remember the ends better
