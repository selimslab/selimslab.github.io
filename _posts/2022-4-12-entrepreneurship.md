What seems like work to other people that doesn't seem like work to you?


## What people want?

What is a market? It’s mass demand 

So what creates mass demand?  It’s deep human desires

They cannot be created, they can only be channeled. It is the wave that every successful product rides, it is what people want 

People don’t buy the thing, they buy the feeling they imagine. 

An off-road car may mean feeling powerful, a photo sharing app may mean feeling connected or admired, an expensive college may mean to feel exceptional 

What people want? The short answer is to feel better 

People want what others want at surface levels but they want same things at the deepest level. For example, to feel 

- liked
- loved
- connected

<br>

- respected 
- in control 
- powerful
- important 

<br>

- secure
- trusted

<br>

- admired 
- exceptional
- better than others 

<br>

- comfortable 
- Peaceful 
- Ease of mind 

<br>

- smart
- beautiful
- Interesting


## Focus 

Focus on what you need to get right and stop worrying for other things



## The user 


Who are the most passionate buyers -> Go meet them 

What do they need -> user interview -> what to ask? -> a story about a recent and specific experience

What is the single most important thing for them?

—

What is the problem? 

Why?

Why?

Why?

Is it urgent? 

Is it frequent?

Are they willing to pay? 

Are they willing to pay now? 

Are they passionate enough about this problem?




Define and clarify the problem 

—

Where to start? Start small, grow like an onion

Do one thing, and do it well 

Do not tell, show



## User Interview 

1. Talk about their life instead of your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past, not about generics in the future
3. Talk less and listen more
Its not personal, not about you, its about their lives and problems 

Keep it casual, thank for compliments, and move on Ask questions, take notes, finish with clear action items 




## Ideas

Great Ideas Seem Initially Bad

They challenge norms and touch taboos. They are contrarian and right.

They unbundle functions layer by layer.

Notice problems instead of thinking ideas

The idea of having ‘‘one idea’’ is false. Team must get dozens of ideas right. Seek a cluster of connected ideas.

Great ideas are about reordering existing + connecting together + right timing.

Creativity is just connecting things. Creative people feel a little guilty because they just saw something obvious. - Steve Jobs
    
Secret = you believe in it + most others don’t + you got the right answer

Secret to get product ideas = don’t think of product ideas

Cultivate a secret about customer and technology.

Work on existing problems. Existing problem means some user wants the solution immediately

Dont look for ideas, just work on things that you find genuinely interesting 

You’ll be most successful where you’re most intensely interested.

## Choose the mountain 

Harder the problem, the better. When you meet a decision point, pick the harder problem


## Unique value

Your unique value proposition is what makes you different.

Delivers a concrete benefit, to an underlying need, using a specific feature

Uncovers a strong truth and names it

Creates tension, urgency, desire in persona’s mind

Others can NOT claim

Clarifies options

You package it in a unique sales proposition


## Sales

First of all, sell something you’re passionate about. 

Break the ice, make a genuine connection, build trust

Understand your audience and their needs, identify pain

Don’t sell. Help. Show that you are here to understand and serve their needs, to help them achieve their goals. Be honest about your product. Know where you stand. Be aware of how your product compares to others on the market, and be able to make a case for yours.

Sell results. Show how your product's characteristics relevant to customer's motivations

Don't push it. Speak a minute and see if they are interested

## Start from the closest 

Your family is broken but you’re going to fix the world?

## Test

One test is worth a thousand expert opinions.

## Direction

Going fast in the wrong direction is not productivity. Think more about what to work on.

Take the best and spread it around, spread subtlety and quality

## Breaking bad news

It’s best to take a straightforward approach. Direct, factual, and empathetic
