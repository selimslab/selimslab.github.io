## What to work on?


> What are the most important problems in your field, 
> 
> and why aren’t you working on them?
> 
> Richard Hamming 

What seems like work to other people that doesn't seem like work to you?

Play a game where the odds are in your favour 

What is like fun to me but work to others?

What makes me lose track of time?

What comes naturally to me?



## What people want?

What is a market? It’s mass demand 

So what creates mass demand?  It’s deep human desires

They cannot be created, they can only be channeled. It is the wave that every successful product rides, it is what people want 

People don’t buy the thing, they buy the feeling they imagine. 

An off-road car may mean feeling powerful, a photo sharing app may mean feeling connected or admired, an expensive college may mean to feel exceptional 

What people want? The short answer is to feel better 

People want what others want at surface levels but they want same things at the deepest level. For example, to feel 

- liked
- loved
- connected

<br>

- respected 
- in control 
- powerful
- important 

<br>

- secure
- trusted

<br>

- admired 
- exceptional
- better than others 

<br>

- comfortable 
- Peaceful 
- Ease of mind 

<br>

- smart
- beautiful
- Interesting


"People don’t buy products because of what those products do, they buy products because of what they imagine they can do   with them.”



## Focus 

Focus on what you need to get right and stop worrying for other things



## The user 

You are not your user 

Don't confuse yourself with your customer

---

Who are the most passionate buyers -> Go meet them 

> 20% of customers 80% of revenue

What do they need -> user interview -> what to ask? -> a story about a recent and specific experience

What is the single most important thing for them?

—

What is the problem? 

Why?

Why?

Why?

Is it urgent? 

Is it frequent?

Are they willing to pay? 

Are they willing to pay now? 

Are they passionate enough about this problem?




Define and clarify the problem 

—

Where to start? Start small, grow like an onion

Do one thing, and do it well 

Do not tell, show



## User Interview 

1. Talk about their life instead of your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past, not about generics in the future
3. Talk less and listen more
4. Its not personal, not about you, its about their lives and problems 

Keep it casual

Thank for compliments, and move on 

Ask questions, take notes

Finish with clear action items 



## Ideas


ideal target = small group of concentrated people, served by few or no competitor 

what important truth do very few people agree with you on?

what valuable company is nobody building?

no secrets would mean a perfect society, no hidden injustice, perfect nutrition, transportation, shelter, perfect access to information, smooth government, happy children, perfect security, healthcare, food, water, shelter, internet for everyone etc..

Great Ideas Seem Initially Bad

They challenge norms and touch taboos. They are contrarian and right.

They unbundle functions layer by layer.

Notice problems instead of thinking ideas

The idea of having ‘‘one idea’’ is false. Team must get dozens of ideas right. Seek a cluster of connected ideas.

Great ideas are about reordering existing + connecting together + right timing.

Creativity is just connecting things. Creative people feel a little guilty because they just saw something obvious. - Steve Jobs
    
Secret = you believe in it + most others don’t + you got the right answer

Secret to get product ideas = don’t think of product ideas

Cultivate a secret about customer and technology.

Work on existing problems. Existing problem means some user wants the solution immediately

Dont look for ideas, just work on things that you find genuinely interesting 

You’ll be most successful where you’re most intensely interested.

[The surprising habits of original thinkers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U)

## Choose the mountain 

Harder the problem, the better. When you meet a decision point, pick the harder problem

if you believe something hard is impossible, you won't even try


## Unique value

Your unique value proposition is what makes you different.

Delivers a concrete benefit, to an underlying need, using a specific feature

Uncovers a strong truth and names it

Creates tension, urgency, desire in persona’s mind

Others can NOT claim

Clarifies options

You package it in a unique sales proposition

Value of a business is the sum of all the money it will make 


## Sales

Build trust, identify pain, sell results

---


First of all, sell something you’re passionate about. 

Break the ice, make a genuine connection, build trust

Understand your audience and their needs, identify pain

Don’t sell. Help. 

Show that you are here to understand and serve their needs, to help them achieve their goals. 

Be honest about your product. 

Know where you stand. 

Be aware of how your product compares to others on the market, and be able to make a case for yours.

Sell results. Show how your product's characteristics relevant to customer's motivations

Don't push it. Speak a minute and see if they are interested

---

Look around, if there are no salesmen, you are the salesman 



incrementalism, risk aversion, complacency, flatness


## Growth ingredients

1. Large market
2. Economies of scale
3. Proprietary IP/technology
4. Network Effects
5. Brand

## Start from the closest 

Your family is broken but you’re going to fix the world?

## Test

One test is worth a thousand expert opinions.

## Direction

Going fast in the wrong direction is not productivity. Think more about what to work on.

Take the best and spread it around, spread subtlety and quality

## Breaking bad news

Nothing is faster than light, except bad news

It’s best to take a straightforward approach. Direct, factual, and empathetic

## Product 

What is the goal of the product?

Who is the customer?

What is the business model for the product?

How should we price the product?

What are the primary features and use cases?

How do we define success and what metrics can we use to track the product?

What are the competitive dynamics and how should we position the product against competitors?

How will the product differentiate?

What are some key distribution channels?

## Delegation 
  

- Is it a discrete chunk of work?
- Does the person have the skills, authority, and tools to be successful?
- Are the timeline, budget, and other constraints are clear?
- Is this work too risky to delegate?


## Product press release

Amazon approach, thinking of a press release before working on a product

Here's an example outline 

* Heading - Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
* Sub-Heading - Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
* Summary - Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
* Problem - Describe the problem your product solves.
* Solution - Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
* Quote from You - A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
* How to Get Started - Describe how easy it is to get started.
* Customer Quote - Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
* Closing and Call to Action - Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.


## Scrum

Sprints: Build software incrementally and iteratively. Deliver working features so you can get customer feedback early and often.

User Stories: Write down ideas to work on and prioritize them. Defer figuring out the details (when this is responsible) because you’ll know more later.

Meetings: Regularly talk as a team about what is going on.

Reviews: Regularly show people what you are building to get feedback.

Retros: Regularly discuss how you can work better as a team.

Product Owner: Have someone who has the knowledge, authority, and availability to prioritize features.

Scrum Master: Have someone focused on process improvement and coordination. This person should ask questions and employ 
coaching. They should not give orders.



## Perception 

What matters is how people perceive your work. How good do they think your work is?



## In writing or didn't happen 

not in an email  ->  "never happened" when it's convenient.

verbally agreed -> send a confirmation email

The written record assures there is a clear and agreed understanding of when the project is a success and how it aims to get there.


## lack of momentum -> burnout

Founders and employees that are burn out nearly always work at startups without momentum. It’s hard to overstate how demoralizing it is.




## How to pitch

1. enemy
2. why now 
3. promised land
4. obstacles/ how to get over
5. present evidence


## Can I work until 40 and then quit to enjoy?

You might start on US$100k, but at 40 you could be on $2m. You’re going to walk away from that?

It won't happen.

Money is an addiction that grabs your soul tight, and it doesn’t let go.

You never have enough.

> Eliminate + Automate + Delegate + Procrastinate + Concentrate

> “If all you have to sell is your time, you’ll never get ahead. Figure out a way to make money even when you’re sleeping if you want to be successful.”

under promise over deliver

## Risk 

Managers are often risk averse. This is because in most companies, creating a large gain for the company will lead to modest rewards...while creating an equal-sized loss will get you fired.


## Transparency

The more information you share internally—good and bad—the better you’ll be.


## Don't take yourself too seriously 

No one cares about you. So you should quit focusing on impressing other people.


## Hiring 

Hire smart and kind people with potential

Agree with crystal clarity on the deliverables

Empower your employees and get out of their way 

Hire people you’d work for 

## Have soft deadlines

The quality of the product is more important than the time it takes to achieve it.

## Careers take care of themselves

If you have skills, commitment and passion, careers tend to take care of themselves.

The world is run by people who have trouble opening a google doc and y'all are worried about imposter syndrome?
## How to solve a business case?

* Define a hypothesis
* Divide different aspects of the problem to mutually exclusive parts, an analysis tree
* Analyze the tree, refining and revisiting the hypothesis as necessary 
* Synthesize your results 
* Communicate the results as clear actionable insights

## ON THE BUS OR OFF THE BUS 

Either fight or not, there is no middle

It takes time to build valuable things

Err on the side of starting too small
