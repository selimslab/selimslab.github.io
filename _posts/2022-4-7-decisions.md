title:  On decisions

Take your time, analyze, sanity check, cross-check, and make a move, don't stuck.

If a decision is reversible, act quickly. 

Most decisions are reversible and we regret the chances we didn't take. 

Be mindful of how you feel and why.

Prevention is the best fix. It is easier to stay out than get out.

Consider second-order and third-order consequences. 

Do not sell your future. 

Never lie to yourself.

Go through a process with people you respect

No by default, if you can't decide, the answer is no
