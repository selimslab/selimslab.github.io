title: Run great engineering teams  
tags: leadership

The turning point in my life was the day I realized to run great engineering teams I didnâ€™t need to be the best engineer in the world, 
I needed to get good at advertising my people 
and their stories up the chain of command. 
I needed to improve their observability so that
 we can keep bureaucracy at bay by maintaining a high level of trust.
