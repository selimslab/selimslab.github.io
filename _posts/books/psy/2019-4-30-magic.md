Into the Magic Shop

wishing a different pass is pointless

worrying about future? don't worry, it will come anyway

your thoughts = your reality

brain chooses what is familiar over unfamiliar 

don't take it for granted

want joy and love -> give love first

heart is a compass

what you want isn't always best for you 

we get sick alone, we get well together

wealth brings happiness -> by giving it away

"my religion is kindness"

clarity, purpose, freedom

everyone has worth, has value, and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. 

everyone deserves love and a chance 

indeed no one deserves anything but anyway give love, give understanding, give respect 

each of us has the ability to heal
