What we give others is judgment, while what we ourselves seek from others is understanding.

To tolerate is to "otherise" you are "allowed" to continue being as you are, but on the outside.

Indifference and neglect are dangerous

We all need to feel heard, loved, understood, respected. 

No one is completely foolish, and we are all foolish in some regards. 

Before dismissing a person or judging too harshly, remember we are all human, and to err is human. 

Look inside. What you understand from your own feelings mostly applies to others. 

Almost all people fears death and rejection, 

we all have regrets, mistakes, insecurities, silly moments. 

The ancient advice has some truth, treat others as you want to be treated.
