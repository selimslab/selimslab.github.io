Real growth is building character, striving to improve in generosity, integrity, humility, fairness, or courage.

Aristotle believed moral goodness is a habit, and it takes time and practice. 

## Courage 

There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.

― Martin Luther King Jr.

Never be afraid to raise your voice for honesty and truth and compassion against injustice and lying and greed. If people all over the world...would do this, it would change the earth.

― William Faulkner

Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one’s definition of your life; define yourself.


## Dare to think for yourself 

We are searching for wisdom in books and talks. 

We seem to believe that other older, wiser, cooler people already sorted things out. It is not. 

Your own reflection on your latest anger will provide you more insight than some brilliant writing on anger.  

Similar with the other emotions and human condition. 

You have already a lot of experience, your own life is full of insight. 

Trust yourself, you are more capable than you think


Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.




## Dare to live 

Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.


Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben. 
(What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.) 


Nothing is done without daring 

Live to the point of tears

## Humility 

I am just another animal, with a brief life, full of shortcomings, living on a piece of dust, in an infinitely big universe. Thinking about my place in the universe, frees me from pride

Arrogance is a weakness. Confident people are humble. You don't have to prove anything.  You don’t need to pretend to be more than you are. 


* We are social animals (groups are smarter than individuals, effectiveness is determined by communication)
* Emotion is the foundation of reason, without it we can’t make decisions
* We are all overconfident (19% think they’re in the top 1% of earners, 95% of professors think they’re better than average)
* We need the mental models and humility to realize we aren’t great

The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.

The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.

Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know.

The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.

I am not young enough to know everything.

Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.

Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us.

Even being hungry or not getting enough sleep clouds our judgement. 

Our thoughts and values are changing. 

Imagine sincerely, what you believe might be wrong. 

in 100 years, there will be no one to remember you 

Astronomy is humbling and corrects the perspective

## Integrity 

Harmony in thoughts words actions 

Nothing can harm a person of integrity

Conform to the nature and reason 

Do what is right. Do it with all your heart

Don’t compromise yourself - you’re all you have 

do nothing against your will

nor against community

nor without due examination

nor with reluctancy 

never pursue anything that requires you to do a bad thing, needs secret of walls, to suspect, to lose your modesty etc. 

The best index to a person's character is how he treats people who can't do him any good, and how he treats people who can't fight back.


## Kindness

Be kind to yourself. If you won’t, who will?

Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.

Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle.

What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?

If I am not good to myself, how can I expect anyone else to be good to me?


## Know thyself

Unconscious feelings and thoughts direct decisions 

"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate."

Don't take yourself too seriously

You have to know what you stand for, not just what you stand against.

Whatever you are, be a good one.

Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.

Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are.


## Know your limits

"Begin at the beginning," the King said, very gravely, "and go on till you come to the end: then stop.

Accept what is in your control and don’t worry for the rest 

You don’t have to be perfect, good enough is good 

Get one bit better, keep walking

“A knower of the Truth does what is called for

then stops

He uses his strength but does not force things”


## Be a friend to yourself

You deserve your love and affection


## Some good heuristics for life:

treat everyone a little better than you want to be treated

listen more than you speak

give more praise than criticism

create and contribute more than you consume

try to leave things a little better than you found them

## Thoughtful 

Words are irreversible

Think twice before you speak

Be careful with promises


## Golden mean

Moderation is key for health and long-term happiness.

Be balanced, humble and confident, thinking and feeling, calm and active. 

Be mindful. View yourself from outside. Pay attention to your mind and heart 

Be grateful. Appreciate all you have and you had, your body and mind, the people you love. Appreciate the moment

## Accept 

I can’t know it all

My experience is subjective 

There are other ways to look at things

I am free to act as long as I don’t unjustly harm others 

I trust my mind and heart to approximate the just course in a given context 

I will make mistakes and it is ok 

I build myself, I choose my way
