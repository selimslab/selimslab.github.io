Aristotle believed moral goodness is a habit, and it takes time and practice. 

To do the right thing, you need to know what's right and to have the courage to do it 

There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.

― Martin Luther King Jr.

Are you still young and dumb enough to know everything?

Do nothing against your will, nor against community, nor without due examination, nor with reluctancy 

Be a friend to yourself, you deserve your love and affection

Don’t compromise yourself, you’re all you have 

Nothing can harm your character

"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate."

"Begin at the beginning," the King said, very gravely, "and go on till you come to the end: then stop.

Words are irreversible

Think twice before you speak

Be careful with promises

Golden mean

Make mistakes and grow 

Treat others as you want to be treated. 

There are other ways to look at things
