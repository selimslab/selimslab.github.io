people are primarily interested in themselves

they want to feel important 

recognition and appreciation are basic needs

pause before answering

people like to be agreed

dislike to be disagreed

poorest way is arguing

way to handle fighters = refuse to fight 

don't assume they like what you like, or want what you want

find out what they are after

speak through 3rd persons, quote others, tell stories, cite facts and stats


praise must be sincere, specific and for the action not the person

say kind things, be humble, be kind

giving = joy 

if you tell the wrong way, tell the right way, too

criticism must be in absolute privacy, for the act, not the person 

be sincere 

say it clearly 

say it distinctly 

thank by name

watch for things to appreciate

being kind, smiling, appreciation = easiest way to create value

say only what you mean 

believe what you say 

enthusiasm is contagious, show it 

say sth. good or say nothing

if you dont know what to say, dont open your mouth 

speak with confidence

say it simply 

be brief

be to the point 

tell what they wanna hear 

knowledge is nothing, doing is everything
