title: How to think better?
---


Examine, select, and use all good ideas  

Listening and speaking clarifies thoughts, 

Taking a walk speaking with a friend is a great way to think. 

A lot of good ideas come in shower, or in a train, or walking

Good ideas are like butterflies, 

they can come near when you are not consciously looking for them 

Thoughts come in bits and pieces. 

If we don't note them down, they will lost in the wind

We shouldn't be looking for heroes, we should be looking for good ideas.

Great ideas = reordering existing + connecting together + right timing
