How do computers work really? What happens under the hood? 

How my keyboard knows what I am writing? 

How the screen knows what to show and how? 

Where is all these files and folders? What is a file anyway?  

Questions follow each other. This got me thinking. First I have read  Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces, then I followed the great [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial). After reading and skimming a few more OS books and [os-dev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page), answers started to come. 


Logos aims to connect the ideas from all these resources and to show how a simple kernel works   

It is able to boot, use screen and keyboard, start a simple shell, get user input, and execute a few commands. Maybe it will have a filesystem later. 

It is 32 bit and the assembly core is written for x86. 

It is developed in 16 steps and heavily commented.
