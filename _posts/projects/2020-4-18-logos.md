How does a computer know how to start? How does it manage resources, run multiple programs at once, keep track of my files? 

How OS works? 

These questions led me to go search for answers. 

First I have read  Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces, then I followed the great [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial). 

After reading the Operating Systems: From 0 to 1 and Writing a Simple Operating System â€” from Scratch below, I have started to understand, re-write, and connect the existing pieces. This project consists of distilled ideas from the books, tutorials, and links listed in repo. 

Logos is able to boot, use screen and keyboard, start a simple shell, and get user input, Maybe it will have a filesystem later. 

It is 32 bit and the assembly core is written for x86.
