title: Classification of high dimensional data

high dimensionality makes it harder to build a model. Luckily a few dimensions explains most of the variability. 

Here 96 dimensional feature vectors generated by Gaussian distributions 
are analyzed with Principal Componenet analysis 

they are reduced to just 3 dimensions, visualized, and full scikit-learn classification suit is tested on them 

[let's take a look at the colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PT1p2G2WK19tO0cH6OLmDFpNLyDWx7r6#scrollTo=RlLvF1UnTyUD)
