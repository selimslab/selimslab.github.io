title: Happiness  
---


Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.

Expect less 

Appreciate more 

Work 

Love 

Share 

Hope 

---

walk no more in shadows 

enjoy the sun 

Speak less, do less, have less 

Want everything, lose everything 

---

Its not worth your peace of mind 

Neither blame yourself nor others

Forgive yourself, forgive others 

Learn and move on 

---

Be a friend to yourself

Love you, accept you, believe in you 

---

People canâ€™t read minds

---

its what you see  

take a different view 

its not that good 

not that bad 

not all or nothing 

not personal 

not all your fault 

doesn't matter that much

will be better 

---

walk slowly but walk 

Find time to just be
