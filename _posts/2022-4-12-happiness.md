Expect less 

Appreciate more 

Work 

Love 

Share 

Hope 


---

Even the darkest night will end 

and the sun will rise.

Walk no more in shadows 

Enjoy the sun 

---

Speak less, do less, have less 

Want everything, lose everything 

---

Its not worth your peace of mind 

Neither blame yourself nor others

---

Forgive yourself, forgive others 

Learn and move on 

---

Be a friend to yourself

Love you, accept you, believe in you 

---

People can’t read minds

---

its how you look  

take a different view 

---

its not that good 

not that bad 

its not all or nothing 

---

its not personal 

its not all your fault 

---

it doesn't matter 

it will be better 

---

walk slowly but walk 

Find time to just be
