title: Happiness

 "To be satisfied on all occasions, and be cheerful." 

How much of our lives have we spent fighting shadows rather than simply enjoying the sun?



## Thoughts create feelings

> "Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be."

The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.


## Meditation 

It's about feeling the moment and clearing the mind. Thinking and writing are great ways. 



## Misfortune 

Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but of playing a poor hand well.

It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.

May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out.

You never know what worse luck your bad luck has saved you from.



## It will pass 

Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.

## Minimize expectations

Happiness = what you have - what you expect

Minimize expectation to minimize disappointment 

## Share 

It is only real when shared

Someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for

## Enjoy 

Life is to be enjoyed, not endured

Enjoy everything, you may not experience it twice.

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think

## Savor the moment 

Beautiful is the moment,

When the heart indifferent

To joy or sorrow, just trusts

Whatever this life brings

But finds time to just be.

## It doesn't matter that much 

> “Nothing in life matters quite as much as you think it does while you are thinking about it.” 


## Gratitude 

People only likes to count their troubles; they don't calculate happiness.

Get cheerful for its own sake, without a reason, to be alive is reason enough 

I can find a million things to complain or a million things to appreciate

Our capacity for worrying is endless and almost nothing worths it. Let it go

If you’re winning but not having any fun, are you really winning?

Want everything, lose everything 

You will lose what you value most, so treasure it while you can.

Don't take it for granted

Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough


## Harmony 

Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.

Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them.


## Right or happy?

I'd far rather be happy than right any day.


## Regrets 

Neither blame yourself nor others

Forgive yourself, forgive others. 

Be kind to yourself. If you won’t, who will? 

Learn and move on 

In the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret


## Self-compassion 

Be a friend to yourself

You deserve your love and affection

## Pleasant surprises

The finest of pleasures are the unexpected ones.

## Simplicity 

meddle not with many things if you wish to live happily 

## Let go of others 

The unhappiest people in this world, are those who care the most about what other people think. Don't let anyone steal your joy

Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of others—that is too high a price to pay.


## Wealth

Wealth brings happiness by giving it away
