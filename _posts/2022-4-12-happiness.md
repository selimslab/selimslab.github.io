Expect less 

Appreciate more 

---

Judge less

Accept more

---

Work 

Share 

Love 

Hope 

--

Less “I know”, 

more “It seems, maybe, probably” 

---

Even the darkest night will end 

and the sun will rise.

---

Walk no more in shadows 

Enjoy the sun 

---


Want everything, lose everything 

What you want isn't always best for you 

---

Neither blame yourself nor others

Its not worth your peace of mind 

---

Forgive yourself, forgive others 

Learn and move on 

---

Be a friend to yourself


---

People can’t read minds

---

its how you look  

take a different view 

---

its not that good 

not that bad 

its not all or nothing 

---

its not personal 

its not all your fault 

---

it doesn't matter 

it will be better 

---

walk slowly but walk 

Find time to just be 

---

It's too easy to take good health for granted.

---

Let not future troubles you, for you will have the same reason 

---

The pain is neither unbearable nor unending, as long as you keep in mind its limits and don't magnify them in your imagination.

---

The reason you don't have energy to workout is because you don't workout.

---

"Youth is happy because it has the capacity to see beauty. Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old."

---

And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good.

---

Do not expect to “get” anything 

Do not expect to be better 

Live as if you listen to music, or you play music 

Play the game 

The aim is the play itself 

---

Speak less, do less, have less
