Take your time, analyze, sanity check, cross check, and make a move. 

Give it a shot. Take a chance. Most decisions are reversible and we regret the chances we didn't take. 

Be mindful of how you feel and why. 

Decisions are based on emotions. People who are unable to feel emotions due to neurological damage are not able to make decisions. [source](https://bigthink.com/experts-corner/decisions-are-emotional-not-logical-the-neuroscience-behind-decision-making)

Prevention is the best fix. It is easier to stay out than get out.

Do not sell your future. Never lie to yourself.

Go through a process with people you respect
