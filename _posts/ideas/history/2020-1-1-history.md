life is competition

people born unfree, unequal, subject to physical and psyc. heredity, customs, traditions

life is selection

probably every vice was once a virtue

managing man, money, things

action <-> reaction 

nations die, civilizations not -> greeks, homer, socrates

death is natural

civilization migrates with him, builds somewhere another home 

in much wisdom, is much grief

our capacity for fretting is endless -> don't worry, be happy
