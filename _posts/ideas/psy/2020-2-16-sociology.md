**Tocqueville** Democracy breeds materialism, envy, shame. The tyranny of majority. False hope is dangerous 

**Weber** Protestant ethics, feeling guilty, glorifying work, emphasizing community 

People imagine leaders as super-parents

People imagine change as dramatic and revolutionary yet most changes are very undramatic, it comes mostly through slow changes in bureaucracy and systematic organization 


**Andy Warhol** We need to mass produce beauty and distribute far and wide. High quality childcare, food, clothing, architecture, therapy, career advice 

**Architecture** Cities should be like ecosystems. City blocks should be small and dense. Mix of old & new buildings


**Durkheim** Why are people unhappy? Loneliness, false hope, responsibility of freedom, less time with friends and family 

**Margaret Mead** Culture determines people far more than suspected. Most traits are not “human nature” but just culture

What we really need is understanding, calm, and insight.

We crave community and connection 

In truth we have the resources for a basic standard for all people 

A small group of committed people can change the world


**Rachel Carson** Silent Spring, DDT, love of nature works better than guilt
