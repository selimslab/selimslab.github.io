**noise -> signal -> story -> decision -> reality**

you simplify, generalize, reduce, stereotype. 

you are irrational and you jump to conclusions.

you find stories and patterns even in sparse data. 

you imagine familiar things as better

you think you know what others are thinking but you don't

you project our current mindset onto the past and future

you favor the immediate over delayed, close over distant, quick and simple over complicated and important 

you tend to keep up status quo to avoid mistakes and preserve status 

you notice the details that confirm our existing beliefs. 

you notice what is new, different, unexpected, repeated often, or primed in memory 

you edit and reinforce some memories after the fact. 

environment has a large impact on your actions.

you notice flaws in others more easily than flaws in ourselves.

We are bad at judging probabilities.

Life is uncertain and luck plays a big role
