A free mind is its own master,

It has conquered its dark side,

<br>

a loving heart is warm like sunshine,

Cool as a fresh wind, 

Feeling the moment, 

Grateful for everything, 


<br>

Feels and accepts all emotions,

Balanced like a mountain, 


<br>

This is a matter of choice,

Anyone can choose to walk this path, 


<br>

The path to freedom and peace of mind 

By working to be a bit better everyday 

<br>

As Marcus Aurelius said, 

Think of yourself as dead.

Now take what's left,

and live it properly.

## Anger

You will feel anger, it’s natural 

Yet do not let anger become your master,

<br>

Words cannot harm the free mind 

Stupidity, insults, and threats ricochet,

<br>

Because what hurts you is not the things,

It is your opinion about them, 

<br>

Anger will come in waves,

The first wave is your chance, 

<br>

The mind either masters it,

or validates and inflames it, 

<br>

You can choose not to be carried away,

If you stop it early, 

it’s much harder later

<br>

So many things to be angry at, 

Do they worth your peace of mind,

Let them go,

<br>


When you have to defend yourself, 

The calm one fights better 



## Greed, anxiety, and fear 

Avoid pain yet doesn’t fear it, 

Appreciate pleasure yet doesn’t chase it,

<br>


Wealth and power,

fame and fortune,

They come and go,

They are not yours,

They are just around you, 

<br>

Doesn’t chase, doesn’t crave 

When you stop craving, 

You will be free from suffering, 

<br>

If you gain something, 

You will not be anxious to keep it,

<br>

You will not be devastated when you lose it, 

You will be free from fear and anxiety, 

## Regret

Let go of the past and the future 

Appreciate the moment,


<br>

Cast aside regret and fear,

Do the deed at hand,

To the best of your ability 


## Pride

I am just another animal,

with a brief life,

full of shortcomings, 

<br>

Living on a piece of dust,

In an infinitely big universe,

<br>

Thinking about my place in the universe,

Frees me from pride

## Happiness

A free mind is cheerful, 

Who can be happier?

<br>

Even in sickness, prison, and death 

It is free from negativity, gloom, and despair 

## Integrity

A free mind doesn’t try to prove anything, 

It is far from lies and shows,

Its integrity worths the world 


## Follow nature and reason 

Think critically,

Follow science,

Question assumptions,

<br>

Look freshly,

Rise above the situation

<br>

Examine life,

As Socrates said,

Unexamined life is not worth living. 


<br>

Think for yourself,

Think freely,

Get rid of dogmas, bigotry, fanaticism


<br>

Don’t leap to conclusions, 

Let go of comparison and judging


<br>

Stop exaggeration

Do not magnify pain,

It is neither unbearable,

Nor unending 


<br>


Conquer your biases,

one by one

## Praise and criticism

They are just opinions

Let them go


## Grateful

Appreciate all you have and you had, 

your body and mind, 

the people you love,

Appreciate the moment


## Balanced

Moderation is key for health,

and long-term happiness.


<br>

golden mean, 

humble and confident, 

thinking and feeling, 

calm and active

## Mindful

View yourself from outside. 

Pay attention,

Being mindful naturally leads to kindness and empathy.


<br>

Words are irreversible,

Think twice before you speak

Be careful with promises


## Healthy 

Watch out what you put in your body,

Keep your health,

Your body and mind 


## Time

Life is not short,

but we waste most of it. 

<br>

Gain good habits

Think long term,

Compound 



## Forgive

Forgive yourself,

Forgive others 

Learn and move on 


<br>

Be kind to yourself,

If you won’t,

Who will?



## Express yourself. 

Do not suppress your emotions, 

do not carry emotional baggage. 

Speak, write, create. 

## Know your limits 

Accept what is in your control,

And don’t worry for the rest 


## Listen 

Do not judge, 

just listen, 

feel, 

understand 


## Emotions are contagious 

Put sunshine, 

get sunshine, 


##  Pick your battles

The poorest way is arguing, 

kindly assert yourself, 

defuse fighters by refusing to fight 


<br>

slow to anger, 

quick to calm



## Life is grey,

Judge less, 

accept more,

Let go of saying “I know”

Say “It seems”,

it appears, 

probably 


## Live simply 

Remove all nonessentials,

talk less, 

do less, 

think less, 

recharge


## One bit better

Do what is right, 

Neither easy nor popular,


<br>

you don’t have to be perfect,

good enough is good 


<br>

Get one bit better,

Keep walking
