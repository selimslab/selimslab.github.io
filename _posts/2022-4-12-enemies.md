You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.

We rarely appreciate all that our enemies do for us.

They test us and make us stronger.

They exploit our flaws, motivating us to correct them.

They show us what we do not wish to become.

So many memorable lessons.

What fine teachers our enemies are.
