Confirmation bias: We are more likely to accept information that aligns with our beliefs than contradictory evidence -- no matter how compelling.

Anchoring effect: The information we receive first acts as an anchor against which we evaluate all further data.

Decoy effect: A third option can sometimes help people choose between two possibilities.

Rhyme-as-reason effect: Rhyming statements seem truer than non-rhyming ones.

Loss aversion: We react more strongly to the possibility of losing something we currently have than the possibility of gaining something we don't.

Peak-end rule: People remember the end and a high point within a presentation more vividly than any other section.

Curse of knowledge: When someone who knows a lot about a given subject is unable to relate to someone who is not as familiar.
