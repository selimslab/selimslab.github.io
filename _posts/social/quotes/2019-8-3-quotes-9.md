A horse having a wolf as a powerful and dangerous enemy lived in constant fear of his life. Being driven to desperation, it occurred to him to seek a strong ally. Whereupon he approached a man, and offered an alliance, pointing out that the wolf was likewise an enemy of the man. The man accepted the partnership at once and offered to kill the wolf immediately, if his new partner would only co-operate by placing his greater speed at the man’s disposal. The horse was willing, and allowed the man to place bridle and saddle upon him. The man mounted, hunted down the wolf, and killed him. “The horse, joyful and relieved, thanked the man, and said: ‘Now that our enemy is dead, remove your bridle and saddle and restore my freedom.’ “Whereupon the man laughed loudly and replied, ‘Never!’ and applied the spurs with a will.

<br><br>
For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness.

<br><br>
Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.

<br><br>
Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.

<br><br>
You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.

Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad.

<br><br>
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.

<br><br>
You cannot protect yourself from sadness without protecting yourself from happiness.

<br><br>
It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.

<br><br>
No medicine cures what happiness cannot.

<br><br>
You can't be happy unless you're unhappy sometimes".

<br><br>
A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.

Unfortunately, the clock is ticking, the hours are going by. The past increases, the future recedes. Possibilities decreasing, regrets mounting.

<br><br>
Time is an illusion.

<br><br>
Time is a created thing. To say 'I don't have time,' is like saying, 'I don't want to.

<br><br>
Those who make the worst use of their time are the first to complain of its brevity.

<br><br>
Don’t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.

<br><br>
Time doesn’t heal emotional pain, you need to learn how to let go.

<br><br>
It's being here now that's important. There's no past and there's no future. Time is a very misleading thing. All there is ever, is the now. We can gain experience from the past, but we can't relive it; and we can hope for the future, but we don't know if there is one.

<br><br>
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

<br><br>
Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.

<br><br>
Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently.

<br><br>
Attitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Optimism is a choice. Kindness is a choice. Giving is a choice. Respect is a choice. Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.

<br><br>
We are addicted to our thoughts. We cannot change anything if we cannot change our thinking.

<br><br>
People tend to complicate their own lives, as if living weren't already complicated enough.

<br><br>
Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them.

<br><br>
Take responsibility of your own happiness, never put it in other people’s hands.

<br><br>
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.

<br><br>
Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value.

<br><br>
It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.

<br><br>
Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.

<br><br>
If A is a success in life, then A equals x plus y plus z. Work is x; y is play; and z is keeping your mouth shut

<br><br>
I'm a success today because I had a friend who believed in me and I didn't have the heart to let him down.

<br><br>
Sometimes it takes a good fall to really know where you stand

<br><br>

<br><br>
The Road Not Taken<br/><br/>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>And sorry I could not travel both	<br/>And be one traveler, long I stood	<br/>And looked down one as far as I could	<br/>To where it bent in the undergrowth;	        <br/> <br/>Then took the other, as just as fair,	<br/>And having perhaps the better claim,	<br/>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;	<br/>Though as for that the passing there	<br/>Had worn them really about the same,	        <br/> <br/>And both that morning equally lay	<br/>In leaves no step had trodden black.	<br/>Oh, I kept the first for another day!	<br/>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,	<br/>I doubted if I should ever come back.	        <br/> <br/>I shall be telling this with a sigh	<br/>Somewhere ages and ages hence:	<br/>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—	<br/>I took the one less traveled by,	<br/>And that has made all the difference.

<br><br>
We love the things we love for what they are.

<br><br>
Tell me, what is it you plan to do <br/>with your one wild and precious life?

<br><br>
Unbeing dead isn't being alive.

<br><br>
One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable words.

<br><br>
Still round the corner there may wait<br/> A new road or a secret gate<br/>And though I oft have passed them by<br/> A day will come at last when I<br/>Shall take the hidden paths that run<br/> West of the Moon, East of the Sun.

<br><br>
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; <br/>I lift my eyes and all is born again.

<br><br>
Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be.

<br><br>
There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of life. <br/>" Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget, that until the day God will deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is contained in these two words, 'Wait and Hope.

<br><br>
If you're reading this...<br/>Congratulations, you're alive.<br/>If that's not something to smile about,<br/>then I don't know what is.

<br><br>
You cannot swim for new horizons until you have courage to lose sight of the shore.

<br><br>
Life's under no obligation to give us what we expect.

<br><br>
But I know, somehow, that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.

<br><br>
Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed.

<br><br>
The things you do for yourself are gone when you are gone, but the things you do for others remain as your legacy.

<br><br>
The very least you can do in your life is figure out what you hope for. 
And the most you can do is live inside that hope. 
Not admire it from a distance but live right in it, under its roof.

<br><br>
You can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep Spring from coming.


<br><br>
Don’t walk in front of me… I may not follow<br/>Don’t walk behind me… I may not lead<br/>Walk beside me… just be my friend
