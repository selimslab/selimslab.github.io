The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair. The beauty of a woman is seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides. True beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It's the caring that she lovingly gives, the passion that she shows & the beauty of a woman only grows with passing years.

To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br/>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br/>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br/>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br/>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;<br/>No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br/>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br/>That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation<br/>Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br/>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;<br/>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br/>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br/>Must give us pause: there's the respect<br/>That makes calamity of so long life;<br/>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br/>The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br/>The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,<br/>The insolence of office and the spurns<br/>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br/>When he himself might his quietus make<br/>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br/>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br/>But that the dread of something after death,<br/>The undiscover'd country from whose bourn<br/>No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br/>And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br/>Than fly to others that we know not of?<br/>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br/>And thus the native hue of resolution<br/>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br/>And enterprises of great pith and moment<br/>With this regard their currents turn awry,<br/>And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!<br/>The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons<br/>Be all my sins remember'd!
