The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.

The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.

Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know.

You have to know what you stand for, not just what you stand against.

Wisdom comes from experience. Experience is often a result of lack of wisdom.

A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it.

The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.
