it makes the life worth living 

love is truly wanting someone to be well and happy, even more than yourself 

it is loving despite the shortcomings of your lover

love is growing together, making each other better

love is education

love is patience

love is loyalty

love is dangerous, it can make and break you 

love is complex, as life
