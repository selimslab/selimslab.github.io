is this the real problem?

is it a priority?

is it important?

is it urgent?

can I simplify it ?

can I eliminate it ?

can I delegate it?

is this what I really want?

what do I feel?

Do I really need this ? 

How well do I know this?

does it worth my time?

does it worth my anger?

what am I willing to struggle for?
