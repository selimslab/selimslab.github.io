## Have that difficult conversation. 

Listen without defensiveness when they criticize you. Name the elephant in the room. Get rejected.

And feel it all. Feel the anticipation of the risk. Feel the pre-risk cringe. Then, during the risk, and after, take a deep breath and feel that too.

You’ll become familiar with those feelings and, believe it or not, you’ll start to enjoy them. Even the ones you think of as unpleasant. Because feeling is what tells you you’re alive.

The more available something is, the less we want it

people want responsibility, respect, and freedom.

The world we have created is a product of our thinking; it cannot be changed without changing our thinking.

humility, adaptability, long time horizons, skepticism of popularity and money 

Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.

Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.

> “If you want to know what a given society believes in, look at what its largest buildings are devoted to.” — Joseph Campbell

## being vulnerable vs insecurity

Vulnerable: exposed, wide open, susceptible to getting hurt.

Insecure: afraid, filled with doubt, not confident.

It takes courage and confidence to allow yourself to be vulnerable.

The more you admit your faults and shortcomings, the more people will like you. 
Being able to admit when you're wrong is a wonderfully attractive quality and gets you a lot of legitimacy. It's endearing.

## Confidence, arrogance, humility 
Arrogance is a weakness.

Confident people are humble because they don't have to prove anything

Don’t ever, ever, ever brag. It never comes off well. Humility wins.
