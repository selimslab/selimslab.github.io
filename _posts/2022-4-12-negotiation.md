You are in charge when you listen

Itâ€™s not a battle, build rapport

Notice emotions, settle, let go 

Ask open-ended questions 

Think before speaking 

Use silence 

Listen, label, paraphrase

Get in their shoes

Assumptions out, hypothesis in 

To quiet your head, focus on the partner 

Positivity is contagious

Understand the market.

Understand your options.

Understand their options.

Decide on your absolute walk-away outcome.

Decide on your ideal outcome.

Negotiate with absolute integrity.
