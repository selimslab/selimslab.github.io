Prepare 

Define your goals and limits 

You are in charge when you listen

Itâ€™s not a battle, build rapport, positivity is contagious 

The point is to win without fighting 

Notice emotions, settle, let go 

Ask open-ended questions 

Think before speaking 

Use silence 

Listen, label, paraphrase

Get in their shoes

Assumptions out, hypothesis in 

To quiet your head, focus on the partner
