The gap between fear and hope, dizziness of freedom

When you face your fear, it vanishes 

To reduce worry, assume the worst. Expect everything, dress rehersal for catastrophe

Don't be over anxious, most things are not worth to be anxious, relax 

Its in my own perceptions, not outside.

How much pain the evils have cost us that have never happened!

Overthinking is a waste of time. Regrets and worry doesn't make it one bit better 

Why worry about things out of your control? 

Worrying doesnâ€™t make it one bit better, use your energy to act instead
