Anxiety is the gap between fear and hope. When you face your fear, it vanishes 

To reduce worry, assume the worst. expect everything, dress rehersal for catastrophe

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

Worrying doesnâ€™t make it one bit better, use your energy to act instead

Don't be over anxious, most things are not worth to be anxious, relax 

Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions-not outside.

How much pain the evils have cost us that have never happened!

Overthinking is a waste of time. Regrets and worry doesn't make it one bit better 


Foragers had less anxiety. no sense in worrying about a thing you can't influence.

in much wisdom, is much grief

our capacity for fretting is endless -> don't worry, be happy
