Observe your thoughts and feelings

Notice a craving, clarify it, and let it go 

Watch your own thoughts from a distance

Mindful, grateful, positive 

Some people feel the rain. Others just get wet.

The world is full of magic things, patiently waiting for our senses to grow sharper.

It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. 

You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.
