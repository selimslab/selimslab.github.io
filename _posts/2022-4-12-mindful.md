Observe your thoughts and feelings

Notice a craving, clarify it, and let it go 

Watch your own thoughts from a distance

Mindful, grateful, positive 

Some people feel the rain. Others just get wet.

The world is full of magic things, patiently waiting for our senses to grow sharper.

We are thrown into the world. 

All being is connected. 

Modern world is distracting us from nature. 

We forget to be free, 

We forget to live 


## Accept 

All comes and all goes

Welcome and farewell
