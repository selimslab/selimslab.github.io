title:  On life  
---


Some quotations are without sources, I don't claim ownership for anything here, the ideas are what's important

## Act 

Only what you do matters

You do not write your life with words...You write it with actions.  What you think is not important.  It is only important what you do

---

He wasn't much good at guessing where his path would lead.

He over-prepared anyway.

Otherwise he might not be ready for the things that didn't happen.

---

Don’t wait, make a decision now and course-correct

---

Planet earth is blue, there’s so much left to do

## Art 

Almost every human activity is an art, and only genuine interest and passion creates beautiful art
## Character 

Real growth is building character, striving to improve in generosity, integrity, humility, fairness, or courage.

You deserve your love and affection

Some good heuristics for life:
- treat everyone a little better than you want to be treated
- listen more than you speak
- give more praise than criticism
- create and contribute more than you consume
- try to leave things a little better than you found them


There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.

― Martin Luther King Jr.

Never be afraid to raise your voice for honesty and truth and compassion against injustice and lying and greed. If people all over the world...would do this, it would change the earth.

― William Faulkner

## Change 

You don’t have to be the person you were yesterday 

## Children 

A child can teach an adult three things: 

to be happy for no reason, 

to always be busy with something,

to know how to demand with all his might that which he desires.

## Choice 

“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” 

― Viktor E. Frankl
## Climate change 

The idea of a "personal carbon footprint" was popularized by BP, the world's 6th largest polluter. They knew that passing the buck onto "individual responsibility" ensured they would never be held accountable.

## Communication 

Express yourself, people can't read your mind 

Do not suppress your emotions

Do not carry emotional baggage

Speak, write, create

Don't try to prove anything, people believe what they want to believe 

Praise and criticism are just opinions. Let them go

The best story wins, not the best idea

Unless you ask, you ain’t getting anything.

Say I don't know more often 

Don't be afraid to ask 

If you want something, ask for it.

Don’t say all you think 

It's a lot easier to keep your house clean when you have frequent guests. Similarly, it's a lot easier to keep your thoughts in order when you share them frequently.

The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn’t being said.

## Community 

We get sick alone, we get well together

Everyone has worth, has value, and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. 

Everyone deserves love and a chance 

Indeed no one deserves anything but anyway showing understanding and respect is better for your character 

Each of us has the ability to heal 

good social relationships -> good life

## Conflict 

Emotions are contagious. Put sunshine, get sunshine 

Slow to anger, quick to calm

Pick your battles 

Simply ask them to thoroughly explain their idea until they notice the flaw themselves 



## Consider beginnings 

Treat small as big, treat few as much 

## Critical thinking 

Delete the adjectives and you have the facts.
― Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird

Systematic criticism and correction

“We shouldn't be looking for heroes, we should be looking for good ideas.”

Truth is ridiculed -> violently opposed -> becomes self-evident

---

How can you be so sure that you have the truth and they are wrong, have you considered all your ideas and others to the bottom? 

Tolerance, common sense. Caution, prudence, a thoughtful respect for tradition 

- Locke 

---

open society 

paradigms 

leaps

shared perspective

all models are wrong, some are useful 

less wrong 

- Popper 

---

“Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see.” 
― Edgar Allan Poe

 Be strategic with the feedback you listen to

## Daring 

Overthinking is a waste of time. Regrets and worry doesn't make it one bit better 

Nothing is done without daring 

## Desire 

You’ll get it when you no longer want it.

## Difficult conversations

Have that difficult conversation. Listen without defensiveness when they criticize you. Name the elephant in the room. Get rejected. And feel it all. You will feel relieved and alive. 

Bitter truths are healing 

## Empathy 

What we give others is judgment, while what we ourselves seek from others is understanding.

To tolerate is to "otherise" you are "allowed" to continue being as you are, but on the outside.

Indifference and neglect are dangerous


## Enemies 

We rarely appreciate all that our enemies do for us.

They test us and make us stronger.

They exploit our flaws, motivating us to correct them.

They show us what we do not wish to become.

So many memorable lessons.

What fine teachers our enemies are.

## Exercise

Exercise is a wonder drug.

The reason you don't have energy to workout is because you don't workout.

## Feedback 

Be strategic with the feedback you listen to

A change of perspective is worth 80 IQ points.


## Finance 

Not all costs are financial. Time, attention, mental and emotional energy are much more valuable

## Flow 

Do it for its own sake 

Do not expect to “get” anything 

Do not expect to be better 

One-up ? 

Play the game 

Ego is part of the play, like a cloud, a wave, a mountain 

Live as if you listen to music, or you play music 

The aim is the play itself 


## Focus 

Human brain is single threaded

Do one thing and do it well 

## Folly 

To folly it belongs to judge things badly, 
to deliberate badly, 
to be bad in social intercourse, 
to use badly present goods, 
to think erroneously about what is good and noble as regards life. 

Folly is accompanied by ignorance, inexperience, incontinence, tactlessness, shortness of memory. 

## Freedom 

Freedom is to conquer your dark side, your anger, greed, hubris, .. 

“To be free from convention is not to spurn it but not to be deceived by it. It is to be able to use it as an instrument instead of being used by it.”

Thinking ability creates free will


## Future 

The future is here but not evenly distributed

If you want to live in the future, live in the freest place around. Because eventually, all of the innovators and creators will show up there.

## Gratitude

Don't take it for granted

Get cheerful for its own sake, without a reason, to be alive is reason enough 
****
I can find a million things to complain or a million things to appreciate

Our capacity for worrying is endless and almost nothing worths it. Let it go

If you’re winning but not having any fun, are you really winning?

Want everything, lose everything 

## Growth 

Replace the model with a better one, strenghten a weak link

It is never too late, get up and walk 

Prevent the worst

Get rid of the worst 

## Habits 

To break a bad habit, focus and feel the habit 

Gain good habits

Make it easy, make it visible, and rewarding 

Stack habits 


## Happiness 

It is only real when shared

Don't let anyone steal your joy

"Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be."

How much of our lives have we spent fighting shadows rather than simply enjoying the sun?

--- 

Happiness = what you have - what you expect

Minimize expectation to minimize disappointment 

---

Someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for

---

Enjoy everything, you may not experience it twice.

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think

---

Beautiful is the moment,

When the heart indifferent

To joy or sorrow, just trusts

Whatever this life brings

But finds time to just be.

---

How much of our lives have we spent fighting shadows rather than simply enjoying the sun?

---

“Nothing in life matters quite as much as you think it does while you are thinking about it.” 

- Daniel Kahneman


People only likes to count their troubles; they don't calculate happiness.

The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.

Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.

Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them.

I'd far rather be happy than right any day.

---

be a friend to yourself


## Health 

Life is extremely fragile. It's too easy to take good health for granted.
## Heart 

Heart is a compass

Whatever you do, do it with all your heart 

“Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart.” 
― Confucius

“Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.” 
― Steve Jobs

## Help 

Put your own oxygen mask on first.


## Hope 

I'd rather be an optimist and wrong than a pessimist and right.

Hope yet remember that hope is not a strategy 
## Humility 

I am just another animal, with a brief life, full of shortcomings, living on a piece of dust, in an infinitely big universe. Thinking about my place in the universe, frees me from pride

* We are social animals (groups are smarter than individuals, effectiveness is determined by communication)
* Emotion is the foundation of reason, without it we can’t make decisions
* We are all overconfident (19% think they’re in the top 1% of earners, 95% of professors think they’re better than average)
* We need the mental models and humility to realize we aren’t great

## Ideas 

great ideas = reordering existing + connecting together + right timing

## Integrity 

Harmony in thoughts words actions 

Nothing can harm a person of integrity

Conform to the nature and reason 

Do what is right. Do it with all your heart

Don’t compromise yourself - you’re all you have 


## Kind 

Be kind to yourself. If you won’t, who will?


## Know your limits

Accept what is in your control and don’t worry for the rest 

You don’t have to be perfect, good enough is good 

Get one bit better, keep walking


## Know thyself

Unconscious feelings and thoughts direct decisions 

"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate."

Don't take yourself too seriously


## Leadership

Leadership is like gardening. You plant the seeds and water them. The growing part is on the plant.

Seeds can become giant trees, yet you can’t force it. 

All you can do is to encourage, to protect, to provide the environment, and to remove obstacles.


“If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.”

— Antoine de Saint-Exupery


## Learning

Genuine interest leads to the best learning. Along with a beginner’s mind, spaced repetition, deliberate practice

Learning = spaced repetition

​The secret to learn is to sincerely get excited, regardless of arbitrary measures for success.

Learning should take place when it is needed, when the learner is interested, not according to some arbitrary, fixed schedule

― Donald A. Norman

-> understanding -> calm -> patience -> practice -> skill ->

## Lies 

We lie to ourselves to feel better because it is easier than making something better in reality 

It’s like taking a painkiller instead of solving the root cause

When you accept yourself as you are the urge to lie will disappear

---

cues that someone might be lying, 

Jests, mimics, fake smiles, too little or too much eye contact

Liers may look down, lower voice, set up a barrier, pepper it with irrelevant details

---

a good way to handle, 

Let go of your anger and contempt

Switch to the curiosity mode

Ask specific questions, go backward

## Love 


Who, being loved, is poor?

Love can't be forced,  
it has to happen naturally

When you truly want them to be well,
even more than yourself 

Love doesn't judge,
it continues despite the shortcomings

Love is to grow together

Love is fragile, 
careless words harm it, 
watch what you say and do 

Love is precious, 
if you love, don't let it go

It twists the mind, 
clouds thinking 

What a great luxury,
to hold your loved ones

When separated,
You see its depth 

Tis better to have loved and lost, 
Than never to have loved at all.



## Mental models 

Invert

Marginal utility

Bias for action

Sperm and egg

Hammer-nail

Attention traps is like bacteria, marketing slogans, slot machines, headlines

When systems look broken, it’s often because the function they’re really trying to serve is not what we think. Schools, hospitals, politics..


## Mistakes 

You need a lot of mistakes for a few good moves, a lot bad ideas for a few good ideas. 

Do not fear making mistakes, do not regret mistakes, you are growing a mistake at a time 

The more you do it, the better you get

"I make mistakes. I say stupid things. I contradict myself even when thinking deeply and rigorously. I change my mind. I get irrationally angry or sad. I say things I don't mean and regret it. I'm human."

Admit responsibility. Fix your mistake Do not make it again

action -> mistake -> experience -> confidence

Don't be sorry, improve yourself.



## Mindful

Observe your thoughts and feelings

Notice a craving, clarify it, and let it go 

Watch your own thoughts from a distance

## Negotiations 

You are in charge when you listen

It’s not a battle, build rapport

Notice emotions, settle, let go 

Ask open-ended questions 

Think before speaking 

Use silence 

Listen, label, paraphrase

Get in their shoes

Assumptions out, hypothesis in 

To quiet your head, focus on the partner 

Smile, positivity is contagious 


## Parenting

what you do, what you say. Actions speak louder than words 

Whatever you say or advice, children will disregard your words and pay attention to your actions. 

Thus the way to raise honest, brave, kind, hardworking, loving children is to be like this yourself because they will look at what you do more than what you say 

Children aren’t fragile, they should learn how to solve problems, how to manage things on their own 

Ignorance isn’t stupidity

if you have a rule, explain the reason, life is much easier when they are convinced

wait a bit before buying something, because they don't really want most things. having a 1 month rule is useful.

Remember a child is very vulnerable 

Let a child be angry. Be patient 

Make sure they are not too compliant 

a way to teach responsibility is to take them seriously and treat them with respect. it makes them feel like grown-ups and they love it 

let a child  be angry, do not yell, remember that they are children and you are the adult

Soft power 

ability to attract and co-opt, rather than coerce (contrast hard power). It involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. Easy way to run the world


## Prioritize 

What’s most important to you? Eliminate everything else.

What I don’t want?


## Probability 

Judge less, accept more. 

Less “I know”, more “It seems, maybe, probably” 

What you want isn't always best for you 

Limits are imaginary

Humble, adaptable, long term thinking, skepticism 

## Problem Solving

prevention is the best

Solve problems before they become problems 

Don't panic

start with a sanity check

ask a lot of questions

state the problem clearly

state your assumptions

question assumptions

start small

a simple example

a simple solution

Complex is the sum of many simple steps

Go see the source

Seek the root cause.

Ask why why why why why

take a walk

Why is this a problem?

Is there an easier way?

What makes it hard to solve? 

Does it have to be solved?

Does it have to be done this way?

Can you cut the knot ?

Be kind to yourself. If you won’t, who will? 

Learn and move on 

In the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret

## Relationships 

Successful relationships tend to bring up even little things that bother them. They don’t let things slide, they continually try to repair their relationship
## Resilience 

In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.

## Scarcity 

Being good at something doesn’t promise rewards. What’s rewarded in the world is scarcity

## Simplicity

Live simply. Remove all nonessentials. Talk less, do less, think less. Recharge

Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking. - Marcus Aurelius 

Experiences make us happier than material things. Happiness from an experience lasts longer. Material things are the worst kind of hedonic adaptation. 

The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it - Henry David Thoreau

Simple ideas govern complex systems

## Sleep 

Alcohol reduces sleep quality, it is one of the worst suppressors of deep sleep 

Happiness consists in getting enough sleep. 

## Smoking

Such a disgustingh waste of time yet I have smoked almost 150 packs through years and inhaled lots of poison for nothing 

## Status 

Universities are not selling education, they are selling membership in an exclusive club.

## Story telling 

Good stories include a change in fortune, a rise and fall, or a fall and rise

## Success

"Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm."

Success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get

Enjoy the journey and don't fret over the results

Think long term and compound 

How alarmed would you be if you only a few years ahead, and how carefully would they use them! You may have even less time in reality

You are how you spend your time.

## Uncertainty

Most people will choose unhappiness over uncertainty.

## Violence

People don’t hate violence, they love it in the right context 




## Wealth

Wealth brings happiness by giving it away



## Work 

Clarity, purpose, freedom, autonomy, mastery

It takes years to become a great engineer, designer, writer, painter.

But it only takes days to become communicative, reliable, and nice to be around — which will put you above 90% of your peers.

---

What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?

The question is, “What pain do you want to sustain?” Not “What do you want to enjoy?” 

---

Follow your inner drive yet  do not hastily give all till nothing left 

Ignore the rat race

Do business with people you like. It’s great.

---

isolation of work from leisure

Elite players train deliberately.

The average players spread their work throughout the day.
