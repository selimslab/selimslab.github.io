title:  Some heuristics for life 
---


You become who you believe you are. You do what you believe you can do.

Judge less, accept more. Less “I know” more “It seems, maybe, probably” 

Emotions are contagious. Put sunshine, get sunshine 

Slow to anger, quick to calm

Pick your battles 

Know your limits. Accept what is in your control and don’t worry for the rest 

You don’t have to be perfect, good enough is good 

Do what is right. Do it with all your heart

Life is not short but we waste most of it

Gain good habits

Think long term and compound 

Get one bit better, keep walking

Think for yourself, see with your own eyes, question, examine 

Don't try to prove anythingi people believe what they want to believe 

Words are irreversible. Think twice before you speak, be careful with promises

Mindful, grateful, moderate, balanced 

Praise and criticism are just opinions. Let them go

Express yourself. Do not suppress your emotions, do not carry emotional baggage. Speak, write, create. 

The best story wins, not the best idea

Live simply. Remove all nonessentials. Talk less, do less, think less. Recharge

Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking. - Marcus Aurelius 

Experiences make us happier than material things. Happiness from an experience lasts longer. Material things are the worst kind of hedonic adaptation. 

The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it - Henry David Thoreau

Neither blame yourself nor others

Forgive yourself, forgive others. 

Be kind to yourself. If you won’t, who will? 

Nothing can harm a person of integrity

Learn and move on

Get cheerful for its own sake, without a reason, to be alive is reason enough 

I can find a million things to complain or a million things to appreciate

Our capacity for worrying is endless and almost nothing worths it. Let it go

Harmony in thoughts words actions 

Conform to the nature and reason 

Power is two sided, ability for great good often comes with ability for great evil. 

I am just another animal, with a brief life, full of shortcomings, living on a piece of dust, in an infinitely big universe. Thinking about my place in the universe, frees me from pride

Overthinking is a waste of time. Regrets and worry doesn't make it one bit better 

Nothing is done without daring 

Genuine interest leads to the best learning. Along with a beginner’s mind, spaced repetition, deliberate practice

If you’re winning but not having any fun, are you really winning?

Think of yourself as dead. Now take what's left, and live it properly. - Marcus Aurelius 

A great way to spend money is to buy time
