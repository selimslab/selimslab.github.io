title:  How to get things done?   
---


You need a lot of mistakes for a few good moves, a lot bad ideas for a few good ideas. Do not fear making mistakes, do not regret mistakes, you are growing a mistake at a time 

The more you do it, the better you get. Sheer volume of music produced is a good predictor for composer success. 

Taking something from 0 to 1 creates value, and so does taking it from 1 to 10 

The ultimate productivity hack is saying no.

Productivity is managing your attention 

You’ll be most successful where you’re most intensely interested.

Chronic stress is harmful yet moderate levels of acute stress helps you grow

Focus on what you need to get right and stop worrying for other things

The antidote to procrastination is courage. Face your fears, face discomfort, you will be glad 

Procrastinating is not always bad. Being quick to start slow to finish may increase more background processing and may lead to original ideas. 

One test is worth a thousand expert opinions.

Don’t think about how proud you would be to run a marathon. Question whether you like running.

A goal without a plan is just a wish. - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

Going fast in the wrong direction is not productivity. Think more about what to work on.

Define what you want because a weak definition means a bad outcome

Dare to say "I don't know"

If you're perfectly qualified to do something, you've already outgrown it

Half doing something is an expensive way of not doing it

Do it with all your heart

Think before you do, plan before you start.

Gain good habits 

Set clear goals, plan, create sytems  

Set up small checkpoints

Eliminate, simplify, chunk, breakdown, prioritize, delegate, focus, get feedback, iterate

Set a time bound, draw a deadline 

Focus on one thing at a time 

Prevent bad things before they happen 

Prioritize important over urgent

Ignore sunk costs 

Write down so you don't have to remember everything 

Make it one bit better

Prevent the worst 

Make work playful

Do not mix work and leisure. Have focused intervals of work and play 

Start small  

Park downhill, stop work with a cliffhanger so it's easier to start again. Save some easy tasks for low motivation periods 

Stay professional, responsible and reliable. 

Everything looks like a failure in the middle, keep going 

What seems like work to other people that doesn't seem like work to you?
