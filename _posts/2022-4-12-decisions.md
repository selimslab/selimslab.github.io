title: Decisions 
---


We make even major decisions carelessly

a little forethought can prevent a lot of pain later. 


---

Solve physical needs before deciding

Get some sleep 

Define goals, inputs, and deadline 

Identify emotions 

Create a process and go through it with people you respect

If its reversible, take a chance
 
It is easier to stay out than get out.

Consider second-order and third-order consequences. 

Do not sell your future. 

Never lie to yourself

“When there is doubt, there is no doubt.”

Build a broad margin of error into your moves

Take a walk 

Make a move, don't stuck
