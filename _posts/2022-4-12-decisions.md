title: Decisions 
---


We rarely think on why we do what we do. 

We make even major decisions with little forethought. 

Yet a little forethought can prevent a lot of pain later.

1. Go through a process with people you respect
2. Be mindful of emotions
3. Prevention is the best fix
4. Consider second and third order consequences
5. If it's reversible, take a chance 
6. Do not sell your future
7. If you can’t decide, it's a no

Take your time, analyze, sanity check, cross-check, and make a move, don't stuck.

If a decision is reversible, act quickly. 

It is easier to stay out than get out

Most decisions are reversible and we regret the chances we didn't take. 

Be mindful of how you feel and why.

Prevention is the best fix. It is easier to stay out than get out.

Consider second-order and third-order consequences. 

Do not sell your future. 

Never lie to yourself

Well done is better than well said

Go through a process with people you respect

No by default, if you can't decide, the answer is no 

“When there is doubt, there is no doubt.”

Sleep on decisons 

Don't be indecisive but not too certain either

Build a broad margin of error into your moves
