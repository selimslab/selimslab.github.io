Why did you do this? 

We make even major decisions with little forethought. 

a little forethought can prevent a lot of pain later.

Sleep, eat, solve physical needs before deciding

Identify emotions 

Create a process and go through it with people you respect

Take your time, analyze, sanity check, cross-check, and make a move, don't stuck.

If its reversible, you may take a chance
 
It is easier to stay out than get out.

Consider second-order and third-order consequences. 

Do not sell your future. 

Never lie to yourself

Well done is better than well said

“When there is doubt, there is no doubt.”

Build a broad margin of error into your moves
