How alarmed would you be if you only a few years ahead, 

and how carefully would they use them! 

You may have even less time in reality

Life is not short but we waste most of it

Think of yourself as dead. Now take what's left, and live it properly. - Marcus Aurelius

You are how you spend your time.

If you don’t spend your life yourself, other people spend it for you.

Don’t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.

All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
