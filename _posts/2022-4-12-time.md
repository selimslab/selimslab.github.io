A great way to spend money is to buy time

Think of yourself as dead. Now take what's left, and live it properly. - Marcus Aurelius 

Life is not short but we waste most of it

Think long term and compound 

How alarmed would you be if you only a few years ahead, and how carefully would they use them! You may have even less time in reality

You are how you spend your time.

Time and attention are the most valuable resources

It’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.

All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.

All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.

Don’t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.

A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.

Time is the longest distance between two places.

Look at everything always as though you were seeing it either for the first or last time: Thus is your time on earth filled with glory.

What is the point of being alive if you don't at least try to do something remarkable?

Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?

Spring is the time of plans and projects.

It is not the length of life, but the depth.

If you don’t spend your life yourself, other people spend it for you.

All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
