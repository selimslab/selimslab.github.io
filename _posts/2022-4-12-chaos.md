title: Emergence and Chaos
---


Basic building blocks following a few simple rules creates complex systems.   

From the most fundamental quantum particles to human societies.   

---

Attraction and repulsion rules between atoms creates simple inorganic molecules.   

Given enough time, it has been observed that organic molecules begin to form.   

---

Molecules converge to a finite number of possible stable states, 

For example proteins are stable structures of amino-acids

---

Another example of convergence is plants and animals in a desert,

they end up with a small set of strategies to survive.    

---

After passing a complexity threshold, a system enters into the land of chaos.   

A minor change today can create enormous differences tomorrow 

There is no ideal and optimal point to arrive,   

the only way is to wait and see.
