title: Chaos

After passing a complexity threshold, a system enters into the land of chaos.   

A minor change today can create enormous differences 

There is no ideal and optimal point to arrive,   

Predicting the result is almost impossible,   

the only way is to wait and see.

Basic building blocks following a few simple rules creates complex systems.   

From the most fundamental quantum particles to human societies.   

Attraction and repulsion rules between atoms creates simple inorganic molecules.   

Given enough time, it has been observed that organic molecules begin to form.   

Then they converge to a finite number of possible stable states, 

For example proteins are stable structures of amino-acids, 

plants and animals in a desert end up with a small set of strategies to survive.
