"Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm."

Success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get

Enjoy the journey and don't fret over the results

For instance, on the planet Earth, 
man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins 
because he had achieved so much, the wheel, New York, wars and so on, 

whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. 
But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man, 
for precisely the same reasons.
