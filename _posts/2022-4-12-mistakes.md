You need a lot of mistakes for a few good moves, a lot bad ideas for a few good ideas. 

Do not fear making mistakes, do not regret mistakes, you are growing a mistake at a time 

The more you do it, the better you get

"I make mistakes. I say stupid things. I contradict myself even when thinking deeply and rigorously. I change my mind. I get irrationally angry or sad. I say things I don't mean and regret it. I'm human."

Admit responsibility. Fix your mistake Do not make it again

action -> mistake -> experience -> confidence

Don't be sorry, improve yourself.

Wisdom comes from experience. Experience is often a result of lack of wisdom.

If you are making mistakes...you're Doing Something.

Learn from the mistakes of others. You can never live long enough to make them all yourself.

Make your mistakes, take your chances, look silly, but keep on going. Donâ€™t freeze up.

walk slow but walk 

Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.
