What’s in my control? What’s not?

What do I NOT want in life?

What would my best version do? 

How do I feel?

Would I treat a friend as I treat myself?

Is this the most important thing I should be working on?

What seems like work to other people that doesn't seem like work to me?

What if I knew I would die this year?
