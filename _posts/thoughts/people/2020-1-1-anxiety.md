summary from [https://ncase.me/mental-health/](https://ncase.me/mental-health/)

Do not fear fear itself.

Pain is a protector.

Fear is a guard dog for your needs.

All feelings are imperfect signals about met/unmet needs.

Our fundamental human needs are: physical needs, social needs, "becoming a better person" needs.

Healthy people don't "cope" with emotions, they collaborate with them. They use "negative" emotions as clues, constructive criticism to improve their lives.

If your fear guard-dog is too hyperactive, don't shoot the dog! Retrain it by forming habits.

Habit = When X, Then Y.

To form habits, have a consistent "When" and simple "Then". Track your progress for ~66 days. One habit at a time.

Physical health affects mental health & vice versa. Hardware affects software, software affects hardware.

9 Mental Health Habits for your software & hardware: Meditation, Journaling, Sleep, Exercise, Eat, Talk with friends, Make new friends, Learning, Practicing virtues.
