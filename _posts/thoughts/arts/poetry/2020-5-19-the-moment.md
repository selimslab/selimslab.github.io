Beautiful is the moment, 

When the heart indifferent

To joy or sorrow, just trusts

Whatever this life brings

But finds time to just be. 

*Yoonoos Peerbocus*

## Lightly

It’s dark because you are trying too hard.

Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly.

Yes, feel lightly even though you’re feeling deeply.

Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them.

*Aldous Huxley, Island*

All that is gold does not glitter, 

Not all those who wander are lost; 

The old that is strong does not wither, 

Deep roots are not reached by the frost. 

*J.R.R. Tolkien*

## I choose the mountain 

The low lands call

I am tempted to answer

They are offering me a free dwelling 

Without having to conquer



The massive mountain makes its move

Beckoning me to ascend

A much more difficult path

To get up the slippery bend



I cannot choose both 

I have a choice to make

I must be wise

This will determine my fate



I choose, I choose the mountain

With all its stress and strain

Because only by climbing

Can I rise above the plane



I choose the mountain 

And I will never stop climbing

I choose the mountain

And I shall forever be ascending


I choose the mountain

## First Day at School 

A millionbillionwillion miles from home

Waiting for the bell to go. (To go where?) 

Why are they all so big, other children? 

So noisy? So much at home they

Must have been born in uniform

Lived all their lives in playgrounds

Spent the years inventing games

That don't let me in. Games

That are rough, that swallow you up. 

<br>

And the railings. 

All around, the railings. 

Are they to keep out wolves and monsters? 

Things that carry off and eat children? 

Things you don't take sweets from? 

Perhaps they're to stop us getting out

Running away from the lessins. Lessin. 

What does a lessin look like? 

Sounds small and slimy. 

They keep them in the glassrooms. 

Whole rooms made out of glass. Imagine. 

<br>


I wish I could remember my name

Mummy said it would come in useful. 

Like wellies. When there's puddles. 

Yellowwellies. I wish she was here. 

I think my name is sewn on somewhere

Perhaps the teacher will read it for me. 

Tea-cher. The one who makes the tea.
