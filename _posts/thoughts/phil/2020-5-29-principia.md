> Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life
> 
> Now take what's left and live it properly.
> 
> – Marcus Aurelius 


What makes you the person you are ? 

We are our principles and they shape our decisions and life. What we think, we become. 

This is my attempt to define a good person and a good life 

### a good person  

* true 

* brave

* moderate

* fair and kind 

* humble and confident

* thinking, feeling, loving

* calm, grateful, active

* wise and brave, temperate and just

### a good life

1. health 

2. freedom

3. integrity 

4. love and friendship

5. meaningful work

6. hope 

7. peace of mind

to achieve this, a few helpful ways are 

* stay healthy

* stay positive and calm

* value yourself, value your time, value your work 

* show your love

* care  

* be social

* communicate well

* pick your battles

* be contentful

* kindly assert yourself

* think for yourself, think critically

* do not regret, learn and move on 

* Be kind to yourself. If you won’t, who will? 

* Forgive yourself
  
* relax, enjoy life

* grow 

* act

* be free from anxiety of results 




## care 

care for body and mind

care for friends and family

care for people, animals, and earth 

care for the future 

## health

water, sleep, healthy food, and sports

clean body, clean mind 

## be positive

our capacity for fretting is endless -> don't worry, be happy 

> We suffer more in imagination than in reality – Seneca

## calm

peace of mind

tranquility 

comfortable

forgiving

slow to anger, quick to calm  

> anger and grief damage more than the things that cause them 

> When angry, count ten before you speak; if very angry, a hundred. — Thomas Jefferson

## social

do not interrupt

do not judge

do not jump to conclusions

do not take yourself too seriously

do not brag, be humble

Pick your battles: Some things are worth fighting over. But most things aren’t.

don't carry baggage, deal with it at the moment


## people first

## communicate well

listen well 

kind and assertive

empathy

breath, posture, voice, tone

speak clearly, with enthusiasm

eye contact

body language

## pick your battles 

disagree respectfully 

constructive feedback 

poorest way is arguing 

Building consensus, understanding emotions, having support are more important than winning an argument

## Simple words with big effects 

no 

no, thank you

I love you 

I think

I feel

I don’t know 

I like

I don’t like 

I agree

I don’t agree

I don’t understand

I’m sorry, that was my fault

Can you help me?





## Moderate

golden mean 

Balance work and play 

Balance fun and seriousness

Balance thinking and doing 


## hope 

> In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.
> 
> ― Albert Camus

hope itself is often better than what you’re hoping for…


## move on 


get up 

don’t give up 

go ahead 

no regrets, hindsight is 20/20

learn and move on


## Think critically

> An unexamined life is not worth living. 
> 
> – Socrates

rise above the situation

disregard the box

watch for biases

question assumptions 

pause and reflect 

think long term 

reflect on the past, plan for the future, enjoy the moment 


## Work and play 

> Do nothing against thy will, 
> nor contrary to the community, 
> nor without due examination, 
> nor with reluctancy. 
> 
> – Marcus Aurelius 

curious 

creative 

responsible

subtlety

quality

reliable

punctual

value your time, value yourself and others  

show your value

professional

do something just because you enjoy it

do what you love and love what you do 

Don’t think about how proud you would be to run a marathon. 
Question whether you like running.

## grow

>
> Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

feedback

Work smart 

Eliminate, simplify, prioritize, delegate, iterate

## Act

bias for action, most decisions are reversible

good enough is good 

Stop waiting, start doing 

Go ahead, just do it, impress yourself
