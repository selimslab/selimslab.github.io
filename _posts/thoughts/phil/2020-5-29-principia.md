What makes you, you? 

Our principles shape our life and decisions. What we think, we become. 

A good life is a happy and meaningful life, there is no single recipe for all, yet it almost always includes health, freedom, good social relationships, and peace of mind

**Essentials** wise, brave, temperate, just, mindful, grateful

## The core concepts

**health** sleep, water, healthy food, and sports, air quality, eliminate sources of stress

**critical thinking**, rise above the situation, disregard the box, watch for biases, question assumptions, do not jump to conclusions, get curious and creative 

**balance**, golden mean 

humble, confident

thinking, feeling

calm, active

**practice empathy** 

**kindness**, be kind to yourself and others

**grow**, flourish, quality, subtlety
 
**do not regret**, forgive yourself, hindsight is 20/20, learn and move on 

We suffer more in imagination than in reality. 

Our capacity for fretting is endless, don't worry, be happy 

**grow**, don't be sorry, improve yourself 

**warm**, put sunshine, get sunshine, emotions are contagious 

**calm**, slow to anger, quick to calm

pick your battles, the poorest way is arguing, kindly assert yourself, defuse figthters by refusing to fight 

**think long term** pause and reflect 

## Work 

**do what you love**, love what you do  

**being professional** means being responsible and reliable 

**Work smart**, goal, plan, system, eliminate, simplify, prioritize, delegate, focus, feedback, iterate 
 
**value your time**, value yourself and others, and show your value

## Communication

listen well 

speak clearly

speak with enthusiasm

integrity

constructive feedback 

breath, posture, voice, tone, body language, suit up  

**simple words with big effects**

No, thank you

I’m sorry, that was my fault

I don’t understand

Can you help me?


## Act 

think before speak 

be careful with promises

bias for action, most decisions are reversible

good enough is good 

Stop waiting, start doing
