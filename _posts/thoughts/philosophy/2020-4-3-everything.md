## People

Good fences make good neighbors.

> “Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.”
>
> ― Leo Tolstoy

The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemicals

No one likes plastic flowers -> be authentic

Actions over words -> Pay attention to what they do

has consequence, has influence

appreciate

You want to be respected? Respect yourself first.

under promise, over deliver

don't argue, ask specific questions

Be assertive and kind 


## story arcs

There are 3 most common patterns

3. Rise, Fall, Recover

## Ask Specific Questions

Simply ask them to thoroughly explain their bad idea until they crash it into to the ground themselves — leaving them open to your idea.

## Things

Less is more

Remove all nonessentials 

## Confidence

Authentic pride means understanding who you are and what you are worth. You don’t need to pretend to be more than you are. 

what pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?

action -> experience -> confidence

“Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”

fortune favors the bold 

If you want something, ask for it.

Care less what people think of you. Way, way less.

No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

Whether you think you can or think you can't, you are right.

It is never too late to be what you might have been.



## Work 

let your love of something pull you, but do not hastily give all of yourself and find there is nothing left to give.

Don’t engage in the achievement rat race. 

Listen to praise from those you respect, but ignore it from those you don’t. 

hope is not a strategy

Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.

Work on the biggest, most frequently used problems you can find, and create the largest net impact. 

Unless you ask, you ain’t getting anything.

## Learning

do not be a full cup of tea, be open to learn

The half of knowledge is knowing where to find it

don't be sorry, improve yourself.

say I don't know more often 

Many limits are imaginary.

ask clarifying questions


## Trust 

Trust is the most delicate thing.

Accept the truth very fast no matter how bitter it is.


## Principia

Sophia,
Andreia,
Dikaiosyne,
Sôphrosynê,

wisdom,
courage,
honesty,
moderation

## Happiness

life is too short to cry for anything.

Drink because you are happy, but never because you are miserable.

> Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be.
>
> Abraham Lincoln

be free from anxiety of results, journey over destination 

want everything, lose everything 

a day spent worrying is a day wasted.

perspective matters, perception is reality 

Don't let anyone steal your joy

# made a mistake ?
Admit responsibility.

Fix your mistake 

Dont make it again


> Do nothing against thy will, nor contrary to the community, nor
without due examination, nor with reluctancy.



### Quit overthinking

Raise your awareness throughout the day. 

Start observing your thoughts.

Limit your thinking to dedicated times. 

do not judge people 

## Time

If we take care of the moments, the years will take care of themselves


As we age, we should spend more time staying fit and less time making money.

## Make habits obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying

We first make our habits, then our habits make us.

Write down current habits to become aware

+ I will do this at that time in that location

+ After doing X, I will do Y 

Make the cue for good habits visible and obvious

Reduce friction, simpler steps, less steps 

Design the environment

Automate habits

Do something you enjoy before and after 

Never miss twice 



## don't say everything you think  
a smiling face and closed thoughts


## our capacity for fretting is endless -> don't worry, be happy 

drink water, eat well, sleep well, stand straight, breath well

be healthy, clean, positive, active

be social, confident, professional

above all, be kind 



mark of strength is not to take yourself too seriously

same actions -> same results 
Act different -> get different results

goals for planning, systems for progress 




Modelin yerine daha iyi bir model koymak, zayıf bir parçayı güçlendirmek, 

To make it one bit better 

To prevent the worst 

Getting rid of the worst 




elite players train deliberately

Don't mix work and leisure 

but make work playful 





important over urgent

in the end, you are left with the adventures and good memories 


either fight or not, there is no middle

ignore sunk costs 

in the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret

Doing is everything. Use your knowledge 

## Pain
What determines your success isn’t “What do you want to enjoy?”
The question is, “What pain do you want to sustain?” 

## Productivity
Finally, to repeat one more time: productivity in the wrong direction isn’t worth anything at all.  Think more about what to work on.


## Be Kind
Being kind isn’t the same as being nice. It isn’t about superficial praise. 
It doesn’t mean dulling your opinions. And it shouldn’t diminish the passion 
with which you present them.

Being kind is fundamentally about taking responsibility for your impact on 
the people around you. It requires you be mindful of their feelings and 
considerate of the way your presence affects them.

## Offline
If you’re serious about making an impact in the world, power down your smartphone, close your browser tabs, roll up your sleeves and get to work.

## Design and Society

In the current age of global wars, international terrorism, financial turmoil, outsourced labor, awakening behemoths (China), increasing corruption, people fear the future.
Look at Apple, classic 1960's space age retro.
Look at Instagram. Cozy and nostalgic polaroid filters.
If I designed for the future, I'd take hints from the past.
A key difference is that in the past, different social groups had something to look forward to (emancipation and liberation), despite the looming threat of thermonuclear warfare. Nowadays? In the western hemisphere? It's all gloom and doom.
In western markets - Your brand should function as an opiate, it should reassure and placate people.
In emerging markets - Sell the American dream of old.
Of course there's a third way, show us a way out of here. But for that advertisement alone is not enough. You'd have to change how your business runs and make a lasting impact on society. Forget shareholder value and start thinking about society.




## Human brain is single threaded
“It's a good idea to save some easy tasks for moments when you would otherwise stall.”


enthusiasm is contagious, show it 

If you can solve your problem, then what is the need of worrying?

If you cannot solve it, then what is the use of worrying?

Refinement of everyday thinking 

isolation of work from leisure

The average players, they discovered, spread their work throughout the day.

“The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.”


When you give the best you have to someone in need, it translates into something much deeper to the receiver. It means they are worthy.

Systematic criticism and correction

Only daring speculation can lead us further 

Simple ideas under complex systems

Simple principles governing complex systems

"recipients of praise do work harder, but only initially. Once they sense the manipulation behind the appreciation, their productivity drops  the beauty of appreciation is spoiled by the lurking intent to get something out of them."


When in doubt, rely on an algorithm, because it's more accurate than your best guess or some expert's opinion. 

We are irrationally. We are prone to jump to conclusions.

## Disagree
It's perfectly OK to disagree with someone;
but please consider doing so in a respectful
and thoughtful tone. 
Remember that others often shut-down when they read criticism,
even when well warranted. 
The way you phrase and present yourself defines whether you're giving criticism or critique.


# learning 
Learning should take place when it is needed, when the learner is interested, not according to some arbitrary, fixed schedule


Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.


Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.

The difference between genius and stupidity is: genius has its limits.

"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate."

be a friend to yourself

askers significantly overestimate the interpersonal costs of asking sensitive questions. 

## craving 
1) Be aware of the cravings whenever they appear, detect them and think "I'm feeling I'm having a craving for X."
  
2) Don't fight it. Let the craving rest in your brain and be conscious of it

## attention 
We notice things that are already primed in memory or repeated often. 

Bizarre/funny/visually-striking/anthropomorphic things stick out more than non-bizarre/unfunny things. 

We notice when something has changed.

We are drawn to details that confirm our own existing beliefs. 

your word is worth more than your weight in gold.

Expect nothing and you’ll never be dissapointed!

Go down the detail by feedback 

My relationships have improved dramatically now that I only share my time with people who really, really want to share their time with me.

tag questions
Isn’t it?
Aren’t you?
Couldn’t we?
Don’t you think?

disagree politely, convincingly, and respectfully.

Work shouldn't affect(nor care) about your private time, and vice versa.

People can be competitive and treacherous, so watch what you say, and how much to whom, never talk negatively, especially about others 

Put sunshine get sunshine 

Put storm get blizzard 

The satisfaction of a little rage is never worth the cost.

My friend didn't give me advice... he gave me SUPPORT.

 there is something all people need, and that is to be heard.
 
  communicate your needs respectfully
  
sometimes people just want to be heard above all else

Give glowing, public praise to the work and behavior I want to see more of, rather than complain about what I want to see less.

 It's not the destination it's the journey
 
Whenever in doubt / under stress: default to being professional as possible.

Identify what’s most important to you.

Eliminate everything else.

don't chase many things, keep the essentials, eliminate all else 

It all takes time. And persistence. And patience.


politely assert yourself,

 I feel, I think, I believe, I don't think, I don't know, I know 
 
## Awareness.
watch yourself from a disrance, 

be aware of thoughts and emotions 


 if you are making mistakes...you're Doing Something

today is 100% of your life 

has consequence, has influence

fortune favors the bold -> be bold
