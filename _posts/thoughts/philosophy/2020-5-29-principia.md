What makes you the person you are ? 

We are our principles and they shape our decisions and life. What we think, we become. 

This is my attempt to define a good person and a good life 

### a good person is
 
* honest and kind

* positive, friendly, warm

* humble, confident, brave

* thinking, feeling, loving

* calm, grateful, active

Go ahead, just do it, impress yourself

### a good life

health 

peace of mind

meaningful work

love and friendship

hope and integrity 


### care 

care for body and mind

care for friends and family

care for people, animals, and earth 

care for the future 

### healthy 

water, sleep, healthy food, and sports

clean body, clean mind 

### Positive

optimist 

enthusiastic

passionate

relax

chill

fresh 

have fun

enjoy life

our capacity for fretting is endless -> don't worry, be happy 


> We suffer more in imagination than in reality 
> 
> – Seneca

> How much pain the evils have cost us that have never happened!


### calm

peace of mind

tranquility 

Love

comfortable

forgiving

slow to anger, quick to calm  

> anger and grief damage more than the things that cause them 

> When angry, count ten before you speak; if very angry, a hundred. 
> 
> — Thomas Jefferson

### communicate well

listen well 

kind and assertive

empathy

breath, posture, voice, tone

speak clearly, with enthusiasm

dress well

eye contact

body language

disagree respectfully 

> If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.

constructive feedback 

poorest way is arguing 

Building consensus, understanding emotions, having support are more important than winning an argument


### Simple words with big effects 

no 

I love you 

I think

I feel

I don’t know 

I like you

I don’t like it 

I agree

I don’t agree

no, thank you

I don’t understand

I’m sorry, that was my fault

Can you help me?

--- 

do not interrupt

do not judge

do not jump to conclusions

do not take yourself too seriously

do not brag, be humble

Pick your battles: Some things are worth fighting over. But most things aren’t.

don't carry baggage, deal with it at the moment


## Be contentful 

> The greatest wealth is to live content with little" Plato 

> "He is rich who is content with the least, for contentment is the wealth of nature" Socrates 

> "The greatest wealth is poverty of desires" Seneca 

> "Wealth consists not in having great possessions but in having few wants" Epictetus

### Moderate

golden mean 

Balance work and play 

Balance fun and seriousness

Balance thinking and doing 


### hope 

> In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.
> 
> ― Albert Camus

hope itself is often better than what you’re hoping for…


### move on 


get up 

don’t give up 

go ahead 

no regrets, hindsight is 20/20

learn and move on


### Think critically

>

disregard the box

watch for biases

question assumptions 

pause and reflect 

think long term 

reflect on the past, plan for the future, enjoy the moment
