spend the afternoon, you cant take it with you 

ignore sunk costs 

in the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret

explore vs exploit 

all human knowledge is uncertain, inexact, partial 

it's very hard to predict the future

what would you do if you could not fail?

if there is no money?

if you had infinite time? 

if you weren't afrtaid?

if all jobs paid the same?

you don't have to do anything, if you face the consequences

lagrangian relaxation -> an optimization problem has two parts, rules and scorekeeping -> bake some rules into scorekeeping -> take the impossible and make it costly 

hard problems demand imagining easier versions, not spinning wheels 

randomness as the heart of creativity 

once you got somewhere happy, it would be stupid to shake it up further 

cool off slowly 

reduce options

politely assert what you want 

computational kindness
