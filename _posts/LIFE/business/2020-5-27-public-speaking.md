## Relax, this is normal 

Flip it to excitement 

Your body reactions are normal 

Say, “This is me feeling anxiety”

Visualize success

Talk over it with friends 

Listen to music, do physical activity, say a tongue twister, play a video game. 

Greet audience, shake hands 

## Shift the focus to audience 

Ask yourself 

“What does my audience need to know about the topic?”  

“How can I ensure that they get it ? 

For each major point think of -> “The bottom line is . . . ”
