A great team is a necessary and insufficient condition. The absence of it will kill the product.

## Who?

Team up with people

a. you’ve known for a long time, and/or

b. you’ve built something unusual together

Pick your team very carefully. Hire slow. Fire fast.

Best product teams start with 2–3 core people.

> “When there is doubt, there is no doubt.” Max Levchin

Founders that are hard to talk to are almost always bad. Communication is a very important skill for founders—in fact, I think this is the most important rarely-discussed founder skill.

## Skill set 

Pick aptitude over experience/expertise.

Pick these skills first: Hacker Hustler Designer Architect

4 skills in 2 people is the ideal.

Hacker builds. Hustler gets resources. Designer defines taste. Architect defines components.

Pick a single Team Lead to make the final call

## do, don’t try

do one thing at a time

do the simplest thing that can possibly work

do the fruitful few that yields most

do other than same things for different result

keep doing

## do one thing well 

No great company I know of started doing multiple things at once—they start with a lot of conviction about one thing, and see it all the way through. You can do far fewer things than you think.
