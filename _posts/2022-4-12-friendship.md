A true friend is someone who you care as much as yourself. 

Their joy is yours and their sorrow too

Respect and trust. 

Both elements have to be there. And it has to be mutual.

You can have respect for someone, but if you don't have trust, the friendship will crumble.

Rare as is true love, true friendship is rarer.

Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. 
Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing.

Count your age by friends, not years.

We don't need money, romance, or luxury.  What we really want is calm, understanding, respect, appreciation.  

Friendships are so rewarding. 

Walk beside meâ€¦ just be my friend
