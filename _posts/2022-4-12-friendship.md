Respect and trust. 

Both elements have to be there. And it has to be mutual.


You can have respect for someone, but if you don't have trust, the friendship will crumble.

Rare as is true love, true friendship is rarer.

Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing.

Walk beside meâ€¦ just be my friend

Count your age by friends, not years.
