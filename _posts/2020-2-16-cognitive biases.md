Humans.

We jump to conclusions.

<br>

We fear what we don’t understand 

so we simplify, generalize, and make up a story.

noise -> signal -> story -> decision 

<br>

Environment matters.

<br>

We tend to do what is quick, easy, comfortable. 

Rather than doing what is important.

<br>

Emotions make decisions. Reason comes later and justifies.

<br>

Mistakes of others are easier to notice. 

Also, they did it since they are bad,

but you did it because of the circumstances. 

Isn’t it?

<br>

We exaggerate the future.

A possible bad event seems way darker, 

and a good one seems way brighter than it will be.

In reality, we will neither be as happy or as miserable as we think.

<br>

Do you think you know what others feel or think? You don’t.

Familiar is better? Not always.

<br>

We believe we are better than we actually are. 

This feeling gets stronger as a person gets more incompetent and ignorant.

<br>

Attention is selective. People see what they want to see. 

We find evidence for what we want to believe.

<br>

Fear of losing is stronger than the hope of winning.

The human brain loves to save energy. 

First information gets anchored into the mind.


<br>

It is easier to remember the end of something
