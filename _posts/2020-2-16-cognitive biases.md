You and me

We are human 

---

Environment affects us more than we suspect

---

We fear what we donâ€™t understand 

---

We tend to do what is quick, easy, comfortable. Rather than doing what is important.

---

Mistakes of others are easier to notice than our own 

We believe we are better than we actually are

We jump to conclusions, judge, and oversimplify 

We choose what is familiar over unfamiliar 

---

We can't read minds

We see what we want to see, believe what we want to believe 

Tell people what they want to hear and you can be wrong indefinitely without penalty

Emotions make decisions. Reason comes later and justifies.

---

We exaggerate

It won't be as good as you hope, neither as bad as you fear 

---

Familiar seems better, often it's not 

---

Rich man in the car paradox. 

Earned success and deserved failure fallacy

---

People like you more than you know 

People think about you way less than you believe 

---

 

Because we are human
