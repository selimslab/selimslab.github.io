# Phil

## Plato

love is education 

Grow together 

Complementary qualities 

Strength in different aspects

Beauty

Beautiful objects encourage us to be like them 

Ugliness is dangerous, it pushes us to be ugly too 

Courage, self-control, reasonableness, independence and calm 

Art is propaganda 

We need senatorship, art could lead to better but worse 

we need better childhoods and better role models

How could a society be better at producing eudaimonia

## Epicurus

two cloaks, lived on bread, olive, and cheese

3 mistakes about happiness 

we don't need money or romantic relationships to be happy 

behind the dream of luxury, what we really want is calm. 

we forget how rewarding friendships are

Aristotle

golden mean 

moral goodness is a habit

Takes time and practice

Art
a Change in fortune 
a moment of dramatic revelation

catharsis

Tragedy reminds terrible things can happen to us all so we shouldn't judge people 

the task of art is to make truth stick 

a true friend is someone who you care as much as yourself 

their joy is yours and their sorrow too 

persuasion 

soothe fears
See the emotional side 
make it short and funny 
use drawings,pictures, video 


## Stoics

anxiety is the gap between fear and hope 

when you face your fear, it vanishes 

to reduce worry, assume the worst 

very little is needed to make a happy life 

expect everything 

Dress rehersal for catastrophe


Anger is the collision of hope and reality 
sad AND unexpected

if you expect anything, nothing makes you much angry


we blame ourselves but most things are so random 

Fortuna 

suspicious of success
gentle on ourselves in failure 

much of what we get, we don't deserve 

astronomy is humbling and corrects the perspective



## Montaigne 

We all shit, so do ladies

Beauty in a simple life 

A virtuous ordinary life is enough 

## Spinoza

Tries to replace bible with Ethics 

is emotion, belief, fear, tradition 

People like religion for community, music, rituals, architecture, tradition, a sense of belonging, hope, fear 

## Schopenhauer 
 
Will to life 

Balanced children

Even a blind mole does anything to live 

To spend as much time with art and philosophy 

## Hegel

Progress is not linear 

There is wisdom in every stage 

Learn from ideas you dislike 

Art helps important ideas stick 

We need institutions to make ideas powerful 

## Nietzsche

Bitterness is hidden envy 

Pleasure and pain comes together 

## Heidegger

Modern world is distracting us from nature 

All being is connected

We forget to be free and live for ourselves

Thrown into the world

Spend more time in graveyards

## Sartre

Things are weirder than we think 

We are freer than we think 

## Camus

There are causes worth dying for, but none worth killing for 

Enjoy the moment

## Adam Smith

The rich accumulate money because they need to be liked and approved

## Marx

Alienation

Commodity fetishism 

## Buddha

Attachment is the root of suffering 

## Lao Tzu

Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished

3 vinegar tasters

Confucius sour, buddha bitter, lao sweet 

Be content with what you have 

Inspired by nature, resilience of trees, strength of mountains, cheerfulness of flowers

Of course there are times for action and ambition

## Sen no Rikyu 

Wabi, simplicity

Sabi, appreciation of the imperfect 

Tea ceremony 

Harmony

Simplest things life offers

Communal life may be great
