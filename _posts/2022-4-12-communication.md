## When you listen

Be present, be interested

If you are not interested, walk away.

Set aside your opinion

Listen with a beginner’s mind.

Do not offer solutions, just listen.

Suspend judgement, it’s not personal, not about you 

Listen to understand, not to answer.

Listen to what isn't being said, too 

## When you speak

Think before you speak

Clarify the message 

Style matters

Have a positive, constructive attitude. 

Emotions drive a conversation 

Breath well

Say something good or say nothing.

Voice and tone  

People can't read your mind, something being obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to them 

Repeat the bottom line

Keep it short and sweet 

Don't try to prove anything, people believe what they want to believe 

The best story wins, not the best idea

Ask questions, make a dialog not a monolog 

it's a easier to keep your thoughts in order when you share them frequently.
