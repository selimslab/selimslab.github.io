## When you listen

Be present, be interested, and if you are not interested, walk away.

Set aside your opinion, listen with a beginner’s mind.

Do not offer solutions, just listen.

Listen to understand, not to answer.

Suspend judgement, it’s not personal, not about you 


## When you speak

Think before you speak. What is the message?

Have a positive, constructive attitude. Say something good or say nothing.

What’s the best way to say it? Style matters.

Be aware of your voice and tone. Breath well.

Emotions matter, pay attention.

What is the bottom line? Repeat important parts.

Unnecessary details are distracting. Keep it short and sweet.

Express yourself, people can't read your mind 

People are busy and something being obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to them 

Do not suppress your emotions

Do not carry emotional baggage

Speak, write, create

Don't try to prove anything, people believe what they want to believe 

Praise and criticism are just opinions. Let them go

The best story wins, not the best idea

Unless you ask, you ain’t getting anything.

Say I don't know more often 

Don't be afraid to ask 

If you want something, ask for it.

Don’t say all you think 

It's a lot easier to keep your house clean when you have frequent guests. Similarly, it's a lot easier to keep your thoughts in order when you share them frequently.

The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn’t being said.

Say only what you mean 

Believe things that you say 

If you don't mean or don't believe, don't say it 

Say something good or say nothing

Is it a good time to talk about?

respond to emails

keep people informed

ask questions, make a dialoge not monolog 

plan what you want to say and refine it 

know your audience, choose the time, listen 

common sense and plain dealing
