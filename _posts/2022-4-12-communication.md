## When you listen

Be present, be interested

If you are not interested, walk away.

Set aside your opinion

Listen with a beginner’s mind.

Do not offer solutions, just listen.

Suspend judgement, it’s not personal, not about you 

Listen to understand, not to answer.

Listen to what isn't being said, too 

## When you speak

Think before you speak

Style matters

Emotions drive the conversation 

Have a positive, constructive attitude. Say something good or say nothing.

Breath, voice, tone 

Repeat the bottom line

Keep it short and sweet 

People can't read your mind, something being obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to them 

The best story wins, not the best idea

Don't try to prove anything, people believe what they want to believe 

monolog vs dialog

It's a easier to keep your thoughts in order when you share them frequently.
