Express yourself, people can't read your mind 

People are busy and something being obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to them 

Do not suppress your emotions

Do not carry emotional baggage

Speak, write, create

Don't try to prove anything, people believe what they want to believe 

Praise and criticism are just opinions. Let them go

The best story wins, not the best idea

Unless you ask, you ain’t getting anything.

Say I don't know more often 

Don't be afraid to ask 

If you want something, ask for it.

Don’t say all you think 

It's a lot easier to keep your house clean when you have frequent guests. Similarly, it's a lot easier to keep your thoughts in order when you share them frequently.

The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn’t being said.

Say only what you mean 

Believe things that you say 

If you don't mean or don't believe, don't say it 

Say something good or say nothing
