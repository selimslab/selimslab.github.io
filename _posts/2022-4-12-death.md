We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! 

That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. 

We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.

I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions of years before I was born, without the slightest inconvenience.

Nations die, civilizations not, greeks, homer, socrates

Civilization migrates and builds somewhere another home 

We should spend more time in graveyards
