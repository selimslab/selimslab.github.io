5. Second-Order Thinking, long term thinking, unintended consequences
   
6. Probabilistic Thinking, probability runs the world 
   
7. **Inversion**, turn it upside down 
   
8. **Occam’s Razor**, Simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones. 

9.  **Hanlon’s Razor**, we should not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity. 

## Physics and Chemistry

1. **Reciprocity**, humans beings act with intense reciprocity demonstrated as well.

2. Thermodynamics, energy is constant and entropy is ever increasing 
   
3. Inertia, objects and people display the same effect. The first move is harder 
   
4. Friction and Viscosity

5. Velocity 

6.  Leverage, almost every great work includes leverage
