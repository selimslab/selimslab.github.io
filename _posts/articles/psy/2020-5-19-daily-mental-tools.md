## Work

Start small, simple to complex 

Focus, work on one thing 

Breakdown tasks 

Just one more 

Park downhill 

save some easy tasks for low motivation periods 

Pre-mortems, prevent bad things before they happen 

## Learning 

Beginnerâ€™s Mind

Spaced repetition 

Deliberate practive 

Separate work from leisure 

## Systems

Write down 

have a goal ? get a plan and system 

Goal -> Plan -> System 

Prioritize 

Iterate

Delegate 

Artificial deadlines

inbox zero 

everything looks like a failure in the middle, keep going 

## Mindfulness

view yourself from outside 

Strategic laziness

talk less, do less, think less -> recharge 

Joy of missing out 

## Reframe

This will all be over by tomorrow 

10/10/10, will it matter in 10 days, 10 months, 10 years ?


## Life is grey 

I know -> it seems, it appears 

Good, bad -> I feel this way because .. 

Grain of salt 

Think for yourself!
