Leadership is like gardening. You plant the seeds and water them. The growing part is on the plant. Seeds can become giant trees, yet you can't force it. All you can do is to encourage, protect, provide the environment, and remove obstacles. 

Main methods of persuasion are inspiration, logic, collaboration, participation, personal appeals, exchange, order, pressure 

Acknowledge, diagnose, listen, and understand the real reason to handle resistance. Clarify false beliefs. Show you consider pros and cons. Show how the approach is fair.

Set achievable goals. Broke large goals into small ones. Explain why, how, what. Would you readily do what you ask them to do? 

Create a blame-free environment to encourage initiative and creative acts 

Punishment should be used sparingly and only in extreme cases because it can lead to resentment. 

Put people above self-interest, career, and comfort. 

People are quick to sense a lack of genuine confidence. Confidence comes from experience and experience comes from making a lot of mistakes and learning from them.
