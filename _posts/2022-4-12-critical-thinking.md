How can you be so sure that you have the truth and they are wrong, 

Have you considered all your ideas and others to the bottom?

Dare to see with your own eyes

"Delete the adjectives and you will have the facts."

All models are wrong, some are useful 

Systematic feedback, criticism, and correction can make us less wrong
