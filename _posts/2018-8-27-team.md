title: The Team
---

A great team is a necessary and insufficient condition. The absence of it will kill the product.


Best product teams start with 2–3 core people.

Pick aptitude over experience/expertise.

Team up with people
a. you’ve known for a long time, and/or
b. you’ve built something unusual together

Pick these skills first: Hacker Hustler Designer Architect

4 skills in 2 people is the ideal.

Hacker builds. Hustler gets resources. Designer defines taste. Architect defines components.

Pick your team very carefully. Hire slow. Fire fast.

> “When there is doubt, there is no doubt.” Max Levchin

Pick a single Team Lead to make the final call

do, don’t try
do one thing at a time
do the simplest thing that can possibly work
do the fruitful few that yields most
do other than same things for different result
keep doing
