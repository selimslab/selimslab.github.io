The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven

There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.

The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.

Perspective creates reality 

You become who you believe you are. You do what you believe you can do.

Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.

Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.

There are no facts, only interpretations.

Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.
