title:  Emotions

Emotions are signals, nuanced and valuable 

Anger often hides something else, like shame or fear 

Fear is often more powerful than hope 

We can choose not to be swayed by our emotions, instead we can just feel and let go 

Its often a bad idea to make a decision when feeling emotional
