title:  On emotions

Emotions are signals, nuanced and valuable 

For example,

Anger often hides something else, like shame or fear 

Fear is often more powerful than hope 

---

Its often a bad idea to make a decision when feeling emotional 

We can choose not to be swayed by our emotions

Just feel and let go 

---

The root of fear is a perceived threat, real or imaginary 

It is often fear under anxiety, anger, and hate 

Anger and hate inflame each other, and lead to suffering
