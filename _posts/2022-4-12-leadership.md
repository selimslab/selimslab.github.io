You plant the seeds and water them, you can’t force the growing  

All you can do is to provide the environment and remove obstacles.

Build projects around motivated people. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

The great ruler speaks little

and his words are priceless

He works without self-interest

and leaves no trace

When all is finished, the people say,

“It happened by itself"

*Tao Te Ching*
