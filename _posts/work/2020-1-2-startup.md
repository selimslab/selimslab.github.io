Great Ideas Seem Initially Bad

They challenge norms and touch taboos. They are contrarian and right.

They unbundle functions layer by layer.

notice problems instead of thinking ideas

The idea of having ‘‘one idea’’ is false. Team must get dozens of ideas right. Seek a cluster of connected ideas.

Great ideas are about <b>reordering existing + connecting together + right timing.</b>

> Creativity is just connecting things. Creative people feel a little guilty because they just saw something obvious.

Secret = you believe in it + most others don’t + you got the right answer

Secret to get product ideas = don’t think of product ideas

Cultivate a secret about customer and technology.

Work on existing problems. Existing problem means some user wants the solution immediately
