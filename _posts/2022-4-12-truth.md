In a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act.

Tell the truth, or someone will tell it for you.

Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters

Better a cruel truth than a comfortable delusion.

Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.

If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you.

All the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust.

Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see.

The more I see, the less I know

Believe nothing until it has been officially denied.
