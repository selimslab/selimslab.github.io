You write your life with actions. 

The future depends on what you do today. 

Do what you feel in your heart to be right, not what is easy nor what is popular. youâ€™ll be criticized anyway.

Make a decision now and course-correct

Who is happier, who has braved the storm of life and lived or who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?

Not all is up to you, do what you can and don't worry for the rest

> Don't give in without a fight
