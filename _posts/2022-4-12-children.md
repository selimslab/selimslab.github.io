Children will disregard your words and pay attention to your actions 

Thus the way to raise honest, brave, kind, hardworking, loving children is to be like this yourself because they will look at what you do more than what you say 

Children aren’t fragile, they should learn how to solve problems, how to manage things on their own 

A way to teach responsibility is to take them seriously and treat them with respect. it makes them feel like grown-ups and they love it 

Ignorance isn’t stupidity

Let a child be angry, be patient, do not yell, remember that they are children and you are the adult  

If you have a rule, explain the reason, life is much easier when they are convinced

Wait a bit before buying something, because they don't really want most things. having a 1 month rule is useful.
