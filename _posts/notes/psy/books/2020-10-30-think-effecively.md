## 1. Strategic thinking

We rarely think on why we do what we do. We make even major decisions with little forethought. Yet a little forethought can prevent a lot of pain later. 

## 2. Cumulative thinking

Thoughts come in bits and pieces. If we don't note them down, they will lost in the wind

## 3. Butterfly thinking

A lot of good ideas come in shower, or in a train, or walking

Good ideas are like butterflies, they can come near when you are not consciously looking for them 

## 4. Independent thinking

We are searching for wisdom in books and talks. We seem to believe that other older, wiser, cooler people already sorted things out. It is not. Your own reflection on your latest anger will provide you more insight than some brilliant writing on anger.  Similar with the other emotions and human condition. You have already a lot of experience, your own life is full of insight. Dare to think for yourself. 

## 5. Focused thinking 

The mind seems to like to generalise. We describe things vaguely. When we say a nice person, a great job, or a fun date, well this is not false but not specific. Being vague prevents us from truly understanding people and situations. So focus, ask yourself, what I **really** mean.

## 6. Philosphical Meditation 

Meditation is about feeling the moment and clearing the mind. Thinking and writing are great ways to meditate and clear mind. Asking yourself questions, thinking on them, and writing down the answers clarifies worries, dissolves hard feelings, and brings calm 

For example, ask yourself 
* what am I anxious about ? 
* what am I upset about ? 
* what am I excited about ? 

The answers will reveal and clarify many untold worries, regrets, hopes and you will feel relaxed. 

## 7. Mad thinking 
Disregard the constraints. What would I do if couldn't fail? if I had infinite time? if money were not a concern ? What if I knew I would die this year? 

## 8. Friend thinking 

Listening and speaking clarifies thoughts, so taking a walk speaking with a friend is a great way to think. 

## 9. Reading 

The aim of reading is not to accept and agree with all we read. We should think on the material, and draw our own conclusions.

## 10. Envy

Society shames envy, yet we all feel it and don't talk about it. Whenever you feel envious, get specific. What exactly are you envious? Mostly it's just a small part of a life. Getting specific enables you to replace envy with understanding. 

## 11. Analogies

Great tools, use them, yet an analogy is only partly true, so they are not to be taken too literally 

## 12. Empathy 
Look inside. What you understand from your own feelings mostly applies to others. Almost all people fears death and rejection, we all have regrets, mistakes, insecurities, silly moments. The ancient advice has some truth, treat others as you want to be treated. 

 ## 13. Death

 Remember death, it makes life much easier. In a dead end job? In a stuck relationship? Putting off things? Not showing kindness to loved ones? Life is short and you may not be here tomorrow morning. Do whatever you wish today.


 ## 14. Love 
We all need to feel heard, loved, understood, respected. No one is completely foolish, and we are all foolish in some regards. Before dismissing a person or judging too harshly, remember we are all human, and to err is human. 

## 15. Sceptical thinking 

Even being hungry or not getting enough sleep clouds our judgement. Oour thoughts and values are changing. Imagine sincerely, what you believe might be wrong. Sleep on decisons. Don't be indecisive but not too certain either. Build a broad margin of error into your moves.
