how to have more human flourishing

flourishing as craft

Social flourishing, includes friendship, business, and romance

Make a lot of mistakes

Quick feedback

improve and iterate

Bias for action leads to a lot of action, more action more mistakes

we don't have time to make all the mistakes, the way is to learn from others mistakes and not repeating your mistakes 

Thus make a lot of "new" mistakes

drug addiction, sugar, alcohol, cigarettes, smart phones, instagram, twitter, fb, netflix, gaming, binge watching, shopping, buying unnecessary stuff 

instant gratification,

taking unnecessary deathly risks,

Adultery

Not caring for your health

Not caring for body and mind

Holding grudges

Accumulating negative feelings

carrying emotional baggage

Not saying no

not speaking your mind

not asserting your thoughts and feelings

debating with ignorant people

debating with random people on the internet

over thinking

Under planning

Under doing

golden mean

**Wrath**, unnecessary excessive anger

**Sloth**, believing you make no difference so doing nothing

**Pride**, thinking you are better than others, for no good reason, snobbishness, belittling people

**Envy**, Be content with what you have, want all, lose all 

**Lust**, sex is not above your character, integrity, and its not the answer to life's questions

**Gluttony**, do not fear hunger, eat only when you hungry

**Greed**, graves have nothing in them, you have nothing to lose
