Great object is victory, not lengthy campaigns. The best is winning without fighting. Not only winning, but winning with ease 

If you only see the obvious, you win by diffuculty. If you look below the surface, you win with ease 

Know yourself and know the enemy 

First eliminate the risk of defeat, than look for victory 

Warfare is deception 

Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.

if you are able to attack, seem unable 

seem inactive if you are active 

seem far when near, near when far 

evade stronger enemy

irritate the enemy, make them angry, if you can't control your anger, you lose 

Pretend to be weak so they grow arrogant 

If the enemy is united, separate them 

Attack unexpectedly. Be prepared and wait to take them unprepared

Harmony in team, discipline, highly trained and talented generals. Consistency and certainty in reward and punishment 

Everyone in team should share the goal 

General should be autonom in military decisions

Recklessness, cowardice, haste, pride, mercy leads to defeat 

Give obeyable orders

Use right man in right place 

To secure ourselves is in our hands. Enemy provides the opportunity to be defeated. Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.

Know when to fight and when not to fight. Plan before the battle, count the cost if you wish to fight 

Haste is stupid but long delays are not clever either

Don't make your enemy desparate, leave an outlet
