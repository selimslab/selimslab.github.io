## Buddha

Attachment and craving cause suffering. To discard craving, train the mind to experience reality as it is. Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional 

## Plato

Love is education, it is to grow together. Complementary qualities, strength in different aspects. 

Art is propaganda. Beautiful objects encourage us to be like them. Ugliness is dangerous, it pushes us to be ugly too. So we need cencorship, art could lead to better but also to worse. 

How can a society have eudaimonia? Better childhoods, better role models, courage, self-control, reasonableness, independence, and calm

## Epicurus

Lived on bread, olive, and cheese and he had two cloaks.  

We don't need money, romance, or luxury.  What we really want is calm, understanding, respect, appreciation.  

Friendships are so rewarding.

Simplest things life offers, like a haiku. Old pond, a frog leaps in, water’s sound 

## Aristotle

**golden mean,** Moral goodness is a habit. Takes time and practice.  

**friendship**, A true friend is someone who you care as much as yourself. Their joy is yours and their sorrow too 

**art**, the task of art is to make truth stick. Tragedy reminds terrible things can happen to us all so we shouldn't judge people. a change in fortune, a moment of dramatic revelation, catharsis

**persuasion** 

* Leverage emotions, soothe fears, feed hopes
* Use visuals, examples, facts, stats, without getting boring 
* Make it short and funny


## Stoics

very little is needed to make a happy life 

Anxiety is the gap between fear and hope. When you face your fear, it vanishes 

To reduce worry, assume the worst. expect everything, dress rehersal for catastrophe

Anger is the collision of hope and reality. Something has to be both sad and unexpected to cause anger. If you expect anything, nothing makes you much angry

We blame ourselves but most things are so random. Be suspicious of success and gentle on ourselves in failure. Much of what we get, we don't deserve 

Astronomy is humbling and corrects the perspective

## Lao Tzu

Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished

Let nature inspire you, trees, mountains, rivers, flowers

Be content with what you have, yet remember that there are times for action and ambition

**3 vinegar tasters**, Confucius sour, Buddha bitter, Lao sweet, like their philosophies of life 

**Montaigne** Beauty in a simple life. A virtuous ordinary life is enough 

**Spinoza** People like religion for community, music, rituals, architecture, tradition, a sense of belonging, hope, fear 

**Schopenhauer**  Will to life, Even a blind mole does anything to live. Love is a mechanism to produce balanced children. A good life is to spend as much time with art and philosophy 

**Hegel** Progress is not linear. There is wisdom in every stage. Learn from ideas you dislike 

Art helps important ideas stick 

We need institutions to make ideas powerful 

**Nietzsche** Bitterness is hidden envy. Pleasure and pain comes together 

**Heidegger** Modern world is distracting us from nature. We are thrown into the world. We forget to be free and live for ourselves. All being is connected. Spend more time in graveyards

**Sartre** Things are weirder than we think. We are freer than we think 

**Camus** There are causes worth dying for, but none worth killing for. Enjoy the moment

**Adam Smith** The rich accumulate money because they need to be liked and approved

**Marx** Alienation, Commodity fetishism 

**Tolstoy** Ask that do I actually see? Literature is a tool of reform. Take pleasure in simple things

**Jane Austen** We should judge people more carefully. Replace material lens with moral lens. Dont be snobbish. Let your lover educate you. 

**Freud** Pleasure & reality balance. Childhood deeply affects adulthood. Analysis of dreams, jokes, parapraxes

**Architecture** Cities should be like ecosystems. City blocks should be small and dense. Mix of old & new buildings


**Andy Warhol** We need to mass produce beauty and distribute far and wide. High quality childcare, food, clothing, architecture, therapy, career advice 


**Tocqueville** Democracy breeds materialism, envy, shame. The tyranny of majority. False hope is dangerous 

**Weber** Protestant ethics, feeling guilty, glorifying work, emphasizing community 

People imagine leaders as super-parents

People imagine change as dramatic and revolutionary yet most changes are very undramatic, it comes mostly through slow changes in bureaucracy and systematic organization 


**Durkheim** Why are people unhappy? Loneliness, false hope, responsibility of freedom, less time with friends and family 


**Rachel Carson** Silent Spring, DDT, love of nature works better than guilt 


## Anna Freud 

People are people not vending machines.  

Ambivalence is the key to be an adult. Life is grey. Nothing is completely good or bad. 

**Defense mechanisms**

1. Denial
2. Projection
3. Turning against the self
4. Sublimation, redirecting to sports, art, career, .. 
5. Regression, getting childish  
6. Rationalisation 
7. Intellectualisation
8. Reaction formation
9. Displacement, redirection to someone weaker 
10. Fantasy 


## Margaret Mead

Culture determines people far more than suspected. Most traits are not “human nature” but just culture

What we really need is understanding, calm, and insight.

We crave community and connection 

In truth we have the resources for a basic standard for all people 

A small group of committed people can change the world
