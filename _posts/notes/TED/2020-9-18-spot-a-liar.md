A million million dollars lost due to corporate corruption 

Lie is the gap between reality and dream 

Average person tells 2 lies a day -> so let me tell 0, 100% truth 

People tell more lies to strangers

 man lie to woman more

 man lie about themselves more

3 lies in a first meeting 

2 parts of deception, speech and body language 

Jests, mimics, fake smiles, too little or too much eye contact

An honest person will be cooperative, help you to seek out the truth, provide details, recommend strict punishment 

Ask specific questions, go backward, 

Liers may look down, lower voice, set up a barrier, pepper it with irrelevant details

what they tell and what they do are not consistent

Discrepancy, like telling a very sad story with unexpected calm

inconsistent words and gestures, saying yes and shaking head for no, shrugging shoulders 

delight of getting away with it, duping delight, 

Masked emotions leaks in a flash 

When anger turns to contempt, it’s very hard to recover, look the other way, reconsider, and walk away 

These are not proof of deception but when they come in clusters, this is your signal 

Switch to the curiosity mode 

Treat with dignity and have some rapport, don’t be aggressive, it doesn’t work
