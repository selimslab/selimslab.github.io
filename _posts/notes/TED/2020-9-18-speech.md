Honesty  -> be clear and straight
 
Authenticity -> be yourself

Integrity -> be your word 

Love -> wish them well 



## Tools 

Register -> from where you speak, chest, throat, nose

Timbre -> warm, like hot chocolate 

Prosody -> tone, monotone, polytone 

deep, warm, colorful, emotion, pace, volume, and silence 


Warm up 

Think before you speak, speak consciously, pay attention to the way you speak, listen consciously 

Why, how, what -> who, when, where
