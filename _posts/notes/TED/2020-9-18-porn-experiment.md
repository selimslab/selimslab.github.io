* frequent porn consumption literally changes brain structure, neurochemical balance, numbs pleasure response, decreases willpower, increases porn sensitivity (just like drugs)
* key driver of people quitting porn: erectile dysfunction aka ED (over time, brain sends weaker and weaker signals to penis)
* older men recover from ED faster than younger men (2-3 vs 4-5 months) because they started watching at later age; older men didnâ€™t start having ED problems until they got high-speed internet (!)
* teen brains more vulnerable: higher dopamine levels, higher neuroplasticity
