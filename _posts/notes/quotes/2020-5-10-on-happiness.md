### happiness 

Happiness is only real when shared

The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.

Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.

Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them.

Attitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Optimism is a choice. Kindness is a choice. Giving is a choice. Respect is a choice. Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.

In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.

Man only likes to count his troubles; he doesn't calculate his happiness.

Happiness consists in getting enough sleep. Just that, nothing more.

But who can say what's best? That's why you need to grab whatever chance you have of happiness where you find it, and not worry about other people too much. My experience tells me that we get no more than two or three such chances in a life time, and if we let them go, we regret it for the rest of our lives.

Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be.

Youth is happy because it has the capacity to see beauty. Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old.


I'd far rather be happy than right any day.

Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life.

Success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get

Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.
