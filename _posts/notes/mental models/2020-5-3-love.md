Who, being loved, is poor?

Love is truly wanting someone to be well and happy, even more than yourself 

it is education, growing together, patience, loyalty

Love is fragile, careless words harm it, watch what you say and do 

Love can't be forced, chasing love doesn't work, it has to happen naturally

Love is precious, if you love, don't let it go

it twists the mind, clouds thinking 

Love is not judgemental, it continues despite the shortcomings

To hold your loved ones is a great luxury 

You see its depth when separated

Tis better to have loved and lost, Than never to have loved at all.
