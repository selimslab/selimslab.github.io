how to have more human flourishing

flourishing as craft
Social flourishing, includes friendship, business, and romance

Make a lot of mistakes
Quick feedback
improve and iterate

Bias for action leads to a lot of action, more action more mistakes

we don't have time to make all the mistakes, the way is to learn from others mistakes and not repeating your mistakes 

Thus make a lot of "new" mistakes

What's left is novel mistakes

drug addiction, sugar, alcohol, cigarettes, smart phones, instagram, twitter, fb, netflix, gaming, binge watching, shopping, buying unnecessary stuff 

instant gratification,
taking unnecessary deathly risks,
Adultery

Not caring for your health
Not caring for body and mind


Holding grudges
Accumulating negative feelings
carrying emotional baggage

Not saying no
not speaking your mind
not asserting your thoughts and feelings

debating with ignorant people
debating with random people on the internet

over thinking
Under planning
Over planning
Under thinking

Aristotle's sweet spot golden mean

Wrath
unnecessary excessive anger

sloth
Believing you make no difference so doing nothing

Pride
Snobbishness
belittling people

Envy
Be content with what you havw

lust
Sex is not the answer to life's questions

Gluttony
do not fear hunger
Eat only when you hungry

Greed
graves have nothing in them
you have nothing to lose
