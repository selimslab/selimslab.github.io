If you want something, ask for it.

action -> mistake -> experience -> confidence

It is never too late, get up and walk 


what pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?

Follow your inner drive yet  do not hastily give all till nothing left 

Ignore the rat race. 

hope yet remember hope is not a strategy


Unless you ask, you ainâ€™t getting anything.

know, understand, act

don't be sorry, improve yourself.

say I don't know

Limits are imaginary.

Bitter truths are healing 

humble, adaptable, long term thinking, skepticism 

enjoy the journey and don't fret over the results 

want everything, lose everything 

worry doesn't make anything one bit better 

Observe your thoughts and feelings

do not take yourself too seriously

perspective is reality 

Don't let anyone steal your joy

Admit responsibility. Fix your mistake Do not make it again

either fight or not, there is no middle

in the end, you are left with the adventures and good memories 

in the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret

Human brain is single threaded

Replace the model with a better one, strenghten a weak link

Simple ideas govern complex systems

alcohol reduces sleep quality 

genius has limits, stupidity has no limits. 


unconscious feelings and thoughts direct decisions 

"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate."

be a friend to yourself

don't be afraid to ask 

Notice a craving, clarify it, and let it go 

Minimize expectation to minimize disappointment
