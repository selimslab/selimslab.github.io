What makes you, you? 

Our principles shape our life and decisions. What we think, we become. 

A good life doesn't necessarily mean a happy life. Pain is inevitable, happiness is just another emotion, and chasing emotions doesn't end well. 

Big things are sum of little things. Life is no exception. 

Everytime we do or say something, we make a decision, mostly unconsciously. These decisions become our actions. The sum of these actions become a lifetime. 

Thus the way is to start small. To pay attention to our actions, words, and how we spend our time.

**Essentials** wise, brave, temperate, just, mindful, grateful

## The core concepts

**health** sleep, water, healthy food, and sports, air quality, eliminate sources of stress

**critical thinking**, rise above the situation, disregard the box, watch for biases, question assumptions, do not jump to conclusions, get curious and creative 

**balance**, golden mean 

humble, confident

thinking, feeling

calm, active

**practice empathy** 

**kindness**, be kind to yourself and others

**grow**, flourish, quality, subtlety
 
**do not regret**, forgive yourself, hindsight is 20/20, learn and move on 

We suffer more in imagination than in reality. 

Our capacity for fretting is endless, don't worry, be happy 

**grow**, don't be sorry, improve yourself 

**warm**, put sunshine, get sunshine, emotions are contagious 

**calm**, slow to anger, quick to calm

pick your battles, the poorest way is arguing, kindly assert yourself, defuse figthters by refusing to fight 

**think long term** pause and reflect 

**do what you love**, love what you do  

**being professional** means being responsible and reliable 

**Work smart**, goal, plan, system, habit, eliminate, simplify, chunk, prioritize, delegate, focus, feedback, iterate

**important** over urgent, ignore sunk costs 
 
**value your time**, value yourself and others, and show your value

**learning** Genuine interest leads to the best learning, not arbitrary rules and fixed schedules 

**habits** You are your habits. Make habits obvious and easy. Time, location, habit stacking 

work to flourish

make it one bit better, prevent the worst 

make work playful and isolate work from leisure . Focused intervals. 

What pain do you want to sustain? 


## Communication

listen well 

speak clearly, with enthusiasm and integrity

constructive feedback 

breath, posture, voice, tone, eye contact, body language

## Act 

Words are irreversible. Think twice before you speak 

be careful with promises

bias for action, most decisions are reversible

good enough is good 

Stop waiting, start doing 


> Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life

Appreciate your body and mind, your family and friends. Appreciate the moment. 

Has consequence, has influence. Respect yourself first 

Less is more. Remove all nonessentials 


Be patient. Take your time.
