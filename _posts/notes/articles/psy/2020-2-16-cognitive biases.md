**noise -> signal -> story -> decision -> reality**

We simplify, generalize, reduce, stereotype. 

We are irrational and we jump to conclusions.

We find stories and patterns even in sparse data. 

We imagine familiar things as better

We think we know what others are thinking but we don't

We project our current mindset onto the past and future

We favor the immediate over delayed, close over distant, quick and simple over complicated and important 

We tend to keep up status quo to avoid mistakes and preserve status 

We notice the details that confirm our existing beliefs. 

We notice what is new, different, unexpected, repeated often, or primed in memory 

We edit and reinforce some memories after the fact. 

We notice flaws in others more easily than flaws in ourselves.
