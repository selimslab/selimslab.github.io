The first relationship is with yourself. If you are not happy with yourself, you won't be happy in a relationship

Love can't be forced, it can only arise naturally and given heartily

Filling gaps with imagination is very dangerous 

Think before you speak and think again.  

Neediness repels. The very essence of flirting is uncertainty. 

Hurry makes waste, time and distance

Face your fears and make a lot of mistakes to build genuine confidence

Set the tone. Positive, constructive, healthy. 

Be a real flower, not a plastic one 

Personal relationships are like chemical reactions. 

People are not vending machines 

Do not promise if possible and if promised, keep it at all costs. 

Don't compromise yourself, keep your integrity, you're all you have.

Cheating is so low and disgusting. If you don't love anymore, just leave, don't cheat 

Don’t be too sad over a breakup, they won’t leave if they love, and everything has an end. 

Your partner is half of your life, choose wisely
