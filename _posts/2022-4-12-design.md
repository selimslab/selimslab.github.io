Design for people,

for the way people behave,

not for how we would wish them to behave.

“Know thy user, and you are not thy user.” — Arnie Lund

---

Choose your audience 

Don’t design for everyone. It makes everyone unhappy. 

---

Test early 

“Testing one user early in the project is better than testing fifty near the end.” 

---

Good design resembles a likable person: respectful, generous and helpful.

---

Get the specifications right

---

Good design is hard to notice because it blends into life 

> Design is like a mom, 
> 
> nobody notices when she’s around, 
> 
> but everybody misses her when she’s not.

---

Design for failure, make things work well even when things do not go as planned.

Take hints from the past

Be mindful of emotions, soothe fears, use nostalgia, give hope 

---

What makes something simple or complex?

It's not the number of dials or controls or how many features it has: 

It is whether the person using the device has a good conceptual model of how it operates.

---

When there is nothing left to take away

a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds

---

Ship it

Usage is like oxygen for ideas.

You can’t make it better until you make it work.

“Release early. Release often.”

A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.

---

Do one thing and do it well 

“The best writing is rewriting.” 

Do today's work, tomorrow might turn out differently
