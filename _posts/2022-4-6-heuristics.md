title:  Some heuristics for life 
---


Life is grey, judge less, accept more. Less “I know” more “It seems, maybe, probably ” 

Forgive yourself, forgive others. Be kind to yourself. If you won’t, who will? Learn and move on 
 
Pick your battles. The poorest way is arguing. Kindly assert yourself. Defuse fighters by refusing to fight 

Live simply. Remove all nonessentials. Talk less, do less, think less. Recharge

You don’t have to be perfect, good enough is good 

Do what is right. Do it with all your heart

Get one bit better, keep walking

Slow to anger, quick to calm

Emotions are contagious. Put sunshine, get sunshine 

Know your limits. Accept what is in your control and don’t worry for the rest 

Express yourself. Do not suppress your emotions, do not carry emotional baggage. Speak, write, create. 

Life is not short but we waste most of it. Gain good habits. Think long term and compound 

Watch out what you put in your body

Words are irreversible, think twice before you speak, be careful with promises

Golden mean. Moderation is key for health and long-term happiness.

Be balanced, humble and confident, thinking and feeling, calm and active. 

Be mindful. View yourself from outside. Pay attention to your mind

Be grateful. Appreciate all you have and you had, your body and mind, the people you love. Appreciate the moment

Praise and criticism. They are just opinions. Let them go

Think for yourself, see with your own eyes, question, examine 

Don't try to prove anything

Think of yourself as dead. Now take what's left, and live it properly.
