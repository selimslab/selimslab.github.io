Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking. - Marcus Aurelius 

Happiness from an experience lasts longer. Material things have the worst kind of hedonic adaptation. 

Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben. (What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.) 

The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it - Henry David Thoreau

Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished

Remove all nonessentials. Talk less, do less, think less. Recharge
