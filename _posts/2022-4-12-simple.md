> Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking. - Marcus Aurelius 

Experiences make us happier than material things. Happiness from an experience lasts longer. Material things are the worst kind of hedonic adaptation. The things you used to own, now they own you.
 
Simple ideas govern complex systems

Everything must be made as simple as possible. But not simpler.

Live simply. Remove all nonessentials. Talk less, do less, think less. Recharge

> The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it - Henry David Thoreau

Like all magnificent things, it's very simple.

Modern world is full of alienation and commodity fetishism 


Wabi sabi, simplicity and appreciation of imperfect 


## Sen no Rikyu 

Tea ceremony 

Harmony, Sympathy, Tranquility, Humility, Lightness, Community 

Simplest things life offers, like a haiku. 

Old pond, a frog leaps in, waterâ€™s sound 


## Lao Tzu

Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished

Let nature inspire you, trees, mountains, rivers, flowers

Be content with what you have, yet remember that there are times for action and ambition


## 3 vinegar tasters

Confucius sour, Buddha bitter, Lao sweet, like their philosophies of life
