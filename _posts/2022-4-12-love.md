When you truly want them to be well, even more than yourself 

Everybody is going to hurt you; you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for.

Love can't be forced, it has to happen naturally

Love doesn't judge, it continues despite the shortcomings

Love is to grow together

Love is fragile, 
careless words harm it, 
watch what you say and do 

It twists the mind, 
clouds thinking 

What a great luxury,
to hold your loved ones

Who, being loved, is poor?

Love is precious, 
if you love, don't let it go

When separated,
You see its depth 

Tis better to have loved and lost, 
Than never to have loved at all.
