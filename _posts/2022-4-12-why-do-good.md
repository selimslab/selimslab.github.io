The short answer is, do good for your own good. 

But why? and how? 

<br>

Nothing is yours, 

Material things, loved ones, not even your body,

Only your actions. 

<br>

You are what you do.

<br>

Most of what you get in life, you don't deserve 

Yet you deserve what kind of person you become, it is your choice 

You pay for what you do by becoming the person you are 

<br>

Degrading and corrupting your heart, losing your integrity and peace of mind, one act at a time? Is it worth it?

Nasty people are neither healthy nor happy. And that’s probably a fair price

<br>

Or we can choose to be a person of character. We can change our worst sides. We are able to change for the better.

You don’t have to be the person you were yesterday
