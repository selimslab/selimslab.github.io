Invert

Marginal utility

Bias for action

Sperm and egg

Hammer-nail

Attention traps is like bacteria, marketing slogans, slot machines, headlines

When systems look broken, it’s often because the function they’re really trying to serve is not what we think. Schools, hospitals, politics..


Ignore sunk costs 

take the impossible and make it costly 

randomness as the heart of creativity 

once you got somewhere happy, it would be stupid to shake it up further 

cool off slowly 

Spend the afternoon, you cant take it with you 

In the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret

explore vs exploit 

All human knowledge is uncertain, inexact, partial

1. The Map is not the Territory
2. Circle of Competence, understand what you know and what you don't know
3. First Principles Thinking, understand the fundemantals
4. Thought Experiment
5. Second-Order Thinking, long term thinking, unintended consequences
6. Probabilistic Thinking, probability runs the world
7. Inversion, turn it upside down
8. Occam’s Razor, Simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones.
9. Hanlon’s Razor, we should not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity.
