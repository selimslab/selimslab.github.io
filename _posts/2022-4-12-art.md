Almost every human activity is an art, and only genuine interest and passion creates beautiful art

Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.

Art helps important ideas stick

Art is propaganda. Beautiful objects encourage us to be like them. Ugliness is dangerous, it pushes us to be ugly too. 

So Plato believed we need cencorship since art could lead to better but also to worse. 

Tragedy reminds terrible things can happen to us all so we shouldn't judge people

a change in fortune, a moment of dramatic revelation, catharsis
