Almost every human activity is an art, and only genuine interest and passion creates beautiful art

It washes away the dust of everyday life, it helps important ideas stick

Art is propaganda. Beautiful objects encourage us to be like them. 

Ugliness is dangerous, it pushes us to be ugly too. 

Tragedy reminds terrible things can happen to us all so we shouldn't judge people, a change in fortune, a moment of dramatic revelation, catharsis
