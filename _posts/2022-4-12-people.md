title: On people

The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen.

Despise The Free Lunch

Emotions are contagious

Anger burns you first

People will never forget how you made them feel

Don't think or judge, just listen. Social skills naturally arise from genuine empathy 

Be kind, not clever

People see what they look for, and hear what they listen for. They don't want to hear the truth. They hear what they want to hear anyway 

Reciprocity is central. Put sunshine get sunshine. Put storm get blizzard. 

Accept people as they are. 

Tell people there's an invisible man in the sky who created the universe, and the vast majority will believe you. Tell them the paint is wet, and they have to touch it to be sure.
