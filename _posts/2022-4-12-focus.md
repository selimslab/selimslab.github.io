Human brain is single threaded

Do one thing and do it well

The mind seems to like to generalise. 

We describe things vaguely. 

When we say a nice person, a great job, or a fun date, well this is not false but not specific. 

Being vague prevents us from truly understanding people and situations. 

Focus, 

ask yourself, 

what do I **really** mean?
