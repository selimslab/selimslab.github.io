Genuine interest leads to the best learning. Along with a beginner’s mind, spaced repetition, deliberate practice

Learning = spaced repetition

​The secret to learn is to sincerely get excited, regardless of arbitrary measures for success.

Learning should take place when it is needed, when the learner is interested, not according to some arbitrary, fixed schedule ― Donald A. Norman

-> understanding -> calm -> patience -> practice -> skill ->

A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier.

Beginner’s Mind

Spaced repetition

Deliberate practice

Separate work from leisure

Education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence.

Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.

Do not teach, make them think

I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.

Never memorize something that you can look up.

If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.

I have never met a man so ignorant that I couldn't learn something from him.

Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment.
