Look inside. What you understand from your own feelings mostly applies to others.

Anger and hate inflame each other, and lead to suffering

The root of fear is a perceived threat, real or imaginary 

It is often fear under anxiety, anger, and hate 

Fear is often more powerful than hope

We all need to feel heard, loved, understood, respected. 

We all have regrets, mistakes, insecurities, silly moments.

No one is completely foolish, and we are all foolish in some regards. 

Before dismissing a person or judging too harshly, remember we are all human, and to err is human. 

What we give others is judgment, while what we ourselves seek from others is understanding.
