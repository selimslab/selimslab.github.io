title: Emotions   
---

Emotions are signals, nuanced and valuable 

## Emotions are contagious

Put sunshine, get sunshine 

## Feel and let go 

Its often a bad idea to make a decision when feeling emotional 

We can choose not to be swayed by our emotions

## Anger 

Often hides something else, like shame or fear 

Slow to anger, quick to calm


## Fear 

The root of fear is a perceived threat, real or imaginary 

It is often fear under anxiety, anger, and hate 

Fear is often more powerful than hope 

## Hate 

Anger and hate inflame each other, and lead to suffering


## Envy

Society shames envy, yet we all feel it and don't talk about it. 

Whenever you feel envious, get specific. 

What exactly are you envious? 

Mostly it's just a small part of a life. 

Getting specific enables you to replace envy with understanding. 


## Desire 

You’ll get it when you no longer want it.

## Hope 

I'd rather be an optimist and wrong than a pessimist and right.

Hope yet remember that hope is not a strategy
