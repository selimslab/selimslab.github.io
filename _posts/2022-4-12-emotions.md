title: Emotions   
---

Emotions are signals, nuanced and valuable 

Pleasure and pain comes together 

## Blame 

We blame ourselves but most things are so random. Be suspicious of success and gentle on ourselves in failure. Much of what we get, we don't deserve 

## Masking 

Anger might mask fear

Bitterness might mask envy 

## Emotions are contagious

Put sunshine, get sunshine 

## Feel and let go 

Its often a bad idea to make a decision when feeling emotional 

We can choose not to be swayed by our emotions

## Anger 

Anger is the collision of hope and reality. 

Something has to be both sad and unexpected to cause anger. If you expect anything, nothing makes you much angry

Often hides something else, like shame or fear 

Slow to anger, quick to calm

The longer I live, the more I observe that carrying around anger is the most debilitating to the person who bears it.

Why should we feel anger at the world? As if the world would notice.

## Fear 

The root of fear is a perceived threat, real or imaginary 

It is often fear under anxiety, anger, and hate 

Fear is often more powerful than hope 

## Hate 

Anger and hate inflame each other, and lead to suffering


## Envy

Society shames envy, yet we all feel it and don't talk about it. 

Whenever you feel envious, get specific. 

What exactly are you envious? 

Mostly it's just a small part of a life. 

Getting specific enables you to replace envy with understanding. 


## Desire 

Youâ€™ll get it when you no longer want it.


Attachment and craving cause suffering. 

To discard craving, train the mind to experience reality as it is. 

Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional 

## Hope 

I'd rather be an optimist and wrong than a pessimist and right.

Hope yet remember that hope is not a strategy
