## Value your work

1. Solve a well defined problem

2. Show your solution to other people as soon as possible

3. Package it and distribute it as soon as possible 

4. Don’t be scared, ashamed, or discouraged to make it paid

5. Don’t let anyone tell you how much you should charge for your work

6. Please value your work and believe that despite the fact that haters are loud, you’re still gonna get a lot of customers who would gladly pay for what you made.



> Work on the biggest, most frequently used problems you can find, and create the largest net impact. Don’t give the customer what they ask for; understand them, and revolutionize their world.

## essentials

Most of the time you spend is wasted time on things that just don’t matter. 

If you can cut out the work and thinking that just doesn’t matter you’ll achieve productivity you’ve never imagined. 

It’s there if you just don’t pay attention to the things that don’t matter.

the art of maximizing the amount of work not done 

Do we really need that feature? 

Can we delete that code? 

Do we really need that command? 

Can we outsource to or partner with another company so that we don't have the build and maintain something?



## Values and Culture


A real value is something like "tell the truth, even when it hurts." Or "deliver the software on schedule, even if there are bugs." In both cases, one can legitimately imagine valuing the opposite.

The job of an executive is to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization, and to ratify good decisions.

That's all. Not to decide. Not to break ties. Not to set strategy. Not to be the expert on every, or any topic. 

Just to sit in the room while the right people make good decisions in alignment with their values. 

And if they do, to endorse it. And if they don't, to send them back to try again.
