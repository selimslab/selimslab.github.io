Freedom is to conquer your dark side, your anger, greed, pride, ..

Its not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.

A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do. - Bob Dylan

“To be free from convention is not to spurn it but not to be deceived by it. It is to be able to use it as an instrument instead of being used by it.”

They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.

Thinking ability creates free will. I am free and that is why I am lost.

These violent delights have violent ends
