Freedom is to conquer your dark side, your anger, greed, hubris, .. 

“To be free from convention is not to spurn it but not to be deceived by it. It is to be able to use it as an instrument instead of being used by it.”

Thinking ability creates free will

Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.

I am free and that is why I am lost.

You don't have to do anything, if you face the consequences

These violent delights have violent ends

    “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” 

    ― Viktor E. Frankl



They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.
