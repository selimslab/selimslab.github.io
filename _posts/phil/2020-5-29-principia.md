## Why principia? 

We don't control most things, not even our own emotions. All we can decide is our words and actions. 

Life is a sum of our feelings, thoughts, words, decisions, and actions. 

To choose the right thing to do, we need guidance and principles to live by. Leading to a deliberate life of consequence.

The way is to start small, paying attention to what we say and do, what we think and feel, and how we spend our time. 

So a good life starts with being mindful and paying attention.  

## Foundations: mindful, grateful, balanced 

**Mindful**, be aware, be open, view yourself from outside. Leads to kindness and empathy. 

**Grateful**, Appreciate all you have and you had, your body and mind, the people you loved. Appreciate the moment. Being grateful is a source of satisfaction, available anytime. 

**Balanced**, golden mean, humble and confident, thinking and feeling, calm and active
 
## Health

keep your body and mind healthy 

sleep, water, work out

healthy food, fruits, veggies

no poisons (smoking, alcohol, drugs, sugar, junk food, processed food) 

Mental health is often neglected. Do not suppress your emotions, do not carry emotional baggage. Kindly assert yourself. Talk, listen, write. Get help when you don't feel well. Having a mental problem is no different than having a physical problem. 

## Time

Life is not short but we waste most of it. 

**Think long term**, pause and reflect 

**Value your time**, value yourself and others, and show your value. Be patient. Take your time. 

**Gain good habits**, You are your habits. Make habits obvious and easy. A clear time, location, and habit stacking helps 

**Grow**, flourish, quality, subtlety. Don't be sorry, improve yourself. Compound 

## Emotions  

**Forgive yourself**, Hindsight is 20/20. Regret has no utility after you understand your mistake. Learn and move on 

**Do not magnify pain**, We suffer more in imagination than in reality. Our capacity for fretting is endless, don't worry, be happy 

**Kindness**, be kind to yourself and others. Be mindful of the effects of your actions

**Let it go** A good life isn't necessarily a happy life. Happiness is just another emotion, and chasing emotions is like chasing the wind. 

## People 

**Practice empathy**, do not judge, just listen, feel, understand 

**Warm**, put sunshine, get sunshine, emotions are contagious 

**Calm**, slow to anger, quick to calm

**The poorest way is arguing**, pick your battles, kindly assert yourself, defuse figthters by refusing to fight 
## Life is grey 
 
There are no hard truths, there are only perspectives. 

Judge less, accept more

A grain of salt is helpful. 

It seems, it appears, probably, I feel this way because.. 

## Less

**Simplicity**, Less is more. Remove all nonessentials 

**Strategic laziness**, talk less, do less, think less, recharge 

Joy of missing out 

## Critical thinking 

Rise above the situation. 

Think for yourself. 

Disregard the box. 

Watch for biases.

Question assumptions.

Do not jump to conclusions

## Learning 

Beginner’s mind

Spaced repetition 

Deliberate practice

Genuine interest leads to the best learning

## Communication

Listen well 

Speak clearly, with enthusiasm and integrity

Constructive feedback 

Breath, posture, voice, tone, eye contact, body language


## How to get things done?

**Be strategic**, Think before you do, plan before you start. Why do you want to do it? Is this the right thing to do? Productivity in the wrong direction is just wasted energy. 

**Do what you love**, love what you do. 

**Work smart**, goal, plan, system, habit. 

Eliminate, simplify, chunk, breakdown

Prioritize, delegate, focus, feedback, iterate

**Set a time bound**, If you don't have a deadline, make up one  

**Focus**, work on one thing 

**Pre-mortems**, prevent bad things before they happen 

**Prioritize**, important over urgent, ignore sunk costs 

**Write down**, so you don't have to remember everything 

**One bit better**, Make it one bit better, prevent the worst 

**Make work playful**, but do not mix work and leisure. Focused intervals. 

**Start small**, simple to complex 

**Professional**, responsible and reliable. Has consequence, has influence. Respect yourself first 

**Park downhill**, stop work with a cliffhanger, so it's easier to start again. Save some easy tasks for low motivation periods 

**Keep walking**, Everything looks like a failure in the middle, keep going 

## On decision making

Take your time, analyze, sanity check, cross check, and make a move. 

Give it a shot. Take a chance. 

If a decision is reversible, act quickly 

Most decisions are reversible and we regret the chances we didn't take. 

Be mindful of how you feel and why 

Prevention is the best fix. It is easier to stay out than get out.

Consider second and third order consequences. 

Do not sell your future. 

Never lie to yourself.

Go through a process with people you respect

No by default, if you can't decide, the answer is no 

## Act 

Words are irreversible. Think twice before you speak. 

Be careful with promises

Good enough is good 

Stop waiting, start doing
