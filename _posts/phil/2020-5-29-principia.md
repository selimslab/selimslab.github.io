What makes you, you? 

For me, it is thoughts, memories, and perspective  

Principles shape decisions. What we think, we become. 
Big things are sum of little things. Life is no exception. 

Everytime we do or say something, we make a decision, mostly unconsciously. These decisions become our actions. The sum of these actions become a lifetime. 

Thus the way is to start small. To pay attention to our actions, words, and how we spend our time.

A good life doesn't necessarily mean a happy life. Pain is inevitable, happiness is just another emotion, and chasing emotions doesn't end well. 

We can not control events but we can control our reaction. 

It is possible to be content, to flourish, to experience eudaimonia even in sickness, in prison, in pain. 

It is possible to be wise, brave, temperate, and just.

## Good, but how?

**Be mindful,** be aware, to be open, leads to kindness and empathy 

**Be grateful**, appreciate, be happy for all you have and you had. Appreciate your body and mind, your family and friends. Appreciate the moment. 

**Practice empathy**, do not judge, just listen, feel, and understand 

**Simplicity** Less is more. Remove all nonessentials 

**Critical thinking**, rise above the situation, disregard the box, watch for biases, question assumptions, do not jump to conclusions, get curious and creative 

**Balance**, golden mean, humble and confident, thinking and feeling, calmand active

**Health** sleep, water, healthy food, exercise 

**Kindness**, be kind to yourself and others

**Grow**, flourish, quality, subtlety, don't be sorry, improve yourself 
 
**Do not regret.**, forgive yourself, hindsight is 20/20, learn and move on 

**Do not magnify pain.**  We suffer more in imagination than in reality. Our capacity for fretting is endless, don't worry, be happy 

**Warm**, put sunshine, get sunshine, emotions are contagious 

**Calm**, slow to anger, quick to calm

**The poorest way is arguing**, pick your battles, kindly assert yourself, defuse figthters by refusing to fight 

**Think long term** pause and reflect 

**Value your time**, value yourself and others, and show your value. Be patient. Take your time. 

**Learn** Genuine interest leads to the best learning, not arbitrary rules and fixed schedules 

**Gain good habits** You are your habits. Make habits obvious and easy. Time, location, habit stacking 


## Work

Work to flourish

Make it one bit better, prevent the worst 

Make work playful and isolate work from leisure . Focused intervals. 

**Be professional**, responsible and reliable. Has consequence, has influence. Respect yourself first 

**Work smart**, goal, plan, system, habit, eliminate, simplify, chunk, prioritize, delegate, focus, feedback, iterate

**Prioritize** important over urgent, ignore sunk costs 
 
What pain do you want to sustain? 

**Do what you love**, love what you do  

## Communication

Listen well 

Speak clearly, with enthusiasm and integrity

Constructive feedback 

Breath, posture, voice, tone, eye contact, body language

## Act 

Words are irreversible. Think twice before you speak 

Be careful with promises

Act, most decisions are reversible

Good enough is good 

Stop waiting, start doing
