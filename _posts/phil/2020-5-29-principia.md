Life is sum of your decisions and actions. A good life is guiding your actions with principles. A deliberate life of consequence.

We don't control most things, not even our own emotions. All we can decide is our words and actions. 

A good life isn't necessarily a happy life. Happiness is just another emotion, and chasing emotions is like chasing the wind. 

The way is to start small. To pay attention to our words, and how we spend our time. 

## Concepts  

**Mindful,** be aware, be open, view yourself from outside, leads to kindness and empathy, deliberation and consequence

**Grateful**, Appreciate all you have and you had, your body and mind, your family and friends. Appreciate the moment. 

**Kindness**, be kind to yourself and others, being kind means taking responsibility of your actions, being mindful of emotional effects   

**Balance**, golden mean, humble and confident, thinking and feeling, calm and active

**Health** sleep, water, healthy food, fruits, veggies, no poison(smoking, alcohol, drugs, sugar, processed food), work out 

**Grow**, flourish, quality, subtlety, don't be sorry, improve yourself 
 

## Time

Life is not short but we waste most of it. 

**Think long term** pause and reflect 

**Value your time**, value yourself and others, and show your value. Be patient. Take your time. 

**Gain good habits** You are your habits. Make habits obvious and easy. Time, location, habit stacking 


## Emotions and People 

**Practice empathy**, do not judge, just listen, feel, understand 

**Warm**, put sunshine, get sunshine, emotions are contagious 

**Calm**, slow to anger, quick to calm

**Forgive yourself** Hindsight is 20/20. Regret has no utility after you understand your mistake. learn and move on 

**Do not magnify pain**  We suffer more in imagination than in reality. Our capacity for fretting is endless, don't worry, be happy 


**The poorest way is arguing**, pick your battles, kindly assert yourself, defuse figthters by refusing to fight 


**Critical thinking**, rise above the situation, think for yourself, disregard the box, watch for biases, question assumptions, do not jump to conclusions


## Life is grey 
 
A grain of salt is helpful. There are no hard truths, there are only perspectives. 

Judge less, accept more

It seems, it appears, probably, I feel this way because.. 


## Less

**Simplicity** Less is more. Remove all nonessentials 

**Strategic laziness**, talk less, do less, think less, recharge 

Joy of missing out 


## Learning 

Beginner’s mind

Spaced repetition 

Deliberate practice

Genuine interest leads to the best learning, not arbitrary rules and fixed schedules 


## Communication

Listen well 

Speak clearly, with enthusiasm and integrity

Constructive feedback 

Breath, posture, voice, tone, eye contact, body language



## How to get things done?

**Be strategic** Think before you do, plan before you start. Why do you want to do it? Is this the right thing to do? Productivity in the wrong direction is just wasted energy. 

**Do what you love**, love what you do. 

**Work smart**, goal, plan, system, habit, eliminate, simplify, chunk, breakdown, prioritize, delegate, focus, feedback, iterate

**Focus**, work on one thing 

**Pre-mortems**, prevent bad things before they happen 

**Prioritize** important over urgent, ignore sunk costs 

**Deadline** if you don't have a deadline, make up one  

**Write down** so you don't have to remember everything 

**One bit better** Make it one bit better, prevent the worst 

**Make work playful**  but do not mix work and leisure. Focused intervals. 

**Start small**, simple to complex 

**Professional**, responsible and reliable. Has consequence, has influence. Respect yourself first 

**Park downhill**, stop work with a cliffhanger, so it's easier to start again. Save some easy tasks for low motivation periods 

Everything looks like a failure in the middle, keep going 

## On decision making

Take your time, analyze, sanity check, cross check, and make a move. 

Give it a shot. Take a chance. Most decisions are reversible and we regret the chances we didn't take. If a decision is reversible, act quickly 

Be mindful of how you feel and why 

Decisions are based on emotions. People who are unable to feel emotions due to neurological damage are not able to make decisions. [source](https://bigthink.com/experts-corner/decisions-are-emotional-not-logical-the-neuroscience-behind-decision-making)


Prevention is the best fix. It is easier to stay out than get out.

Consider second and third order consequences. 

Do not sell your future. Never lie to yourself.

Go through a process with people you respect

No by default, if you can't decide, the answer is no 

## Act 

Words are irreversible. Think twice before you speak. 

Be careful with promises

Good enough is good 

Stop waiting, start doing
