― William Shakespeare

 A little forethought can prevent a lot of pain later.

 Make a move. Don’t overanalyze everything.

 Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason

 second and third order consequences

 you miss 100% of the shots you don't take

 It is easier to stay out than get out.

 Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.

 The perfect moment is NOW

 hope is not a strategy

 In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.

 do not sell your future

 Don’t spend a dollar’s worth of time on a ten cent decision.

 go through a process with people you respect

 NEVER lie to yourself.

 Fail. But do it quickly and learn a lesson.

 cross check

sanity check

NO: Learn to say No.

you get what you measure

don't make hasty decisions.

It’s easy to mistake excitement for passion, motivation and ability.

Face Your Problems: Don't delay.

There are no silver bullets; there are no shortcuts.

## Thinking, Fast and Slow
From the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/264543341?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1">
	great review </a> 

 We are irrationally prone to jump to conclusions based on rule-of-thumb shortcuts to actual reasoning, and in reliance on bad evidence, even though we have the capacity to think our way to better conclusions. But we're lazy, so we don't. 

Your environment has a large impact on your actions.

We don't understand statistics, and if we did, we'd be more cautious in our judgments, and less prone to think highly of our own skill at judging probabilities and outcomes. 

Life not only is uncertain, we cannot understand it systemically, and luck has just as much to do with what happens to us -- maybe even more -- than we care to admit. 


When in doubt, rely on an algorithm, because it's more accurate than your best guess or some expert's opinion. 

Above all, determine the baseline before you come to any decisions.
