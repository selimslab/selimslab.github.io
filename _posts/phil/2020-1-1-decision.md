― William Shakespeare

 A little forethought can prevent a lot of pain later.

 Make a move. Don’t overanalyze everything.

 Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason

 second and third order consequences

 you miss 100% of the shots you don't take

 It is easier to stay out than get out.

 Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.

 The perfect moment is NOW

 hope is not a strategy

 In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.

 do not sell your future

 Don’t spend a dollar’s worth of time on a ten cent decision.

 go through a process with people you respect

 NEVER lie to yourself.

 Fail. But do it quickly and learn a lesson.

 cross check

sanity check

NO: Learn to say No.

you get what you measure

don't make hasty decisions.

It’s easy to mistake excitement for passion, motivation and ability.

Face Your Problems: Don't delay.

There are no silver bullets; there are no shortcuts.
