do nothing against your will

nor against community

nor without due examination

nor with reluctancy 

never pursue anything that requires you to do a bad thing, needs secret of walls, to suspect, to lose your modesty etc. 

in 100 years, there will be no one to remember you 

meddle not with many things if you wish to live happily 

let not future troubles you, for you will have the same reason 

who is slow yet quick, merry yet grave -> who follows the reason as a guide 

- Why should we feel anger at the world? As if the world would notice.
- The pain is neither unbearable nor unending, as long as you keep in mind its limits and don't magnify them in your imagination.
- Pray not to feel fear. Or desire, or grief.
- Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions-not outside.
- An arrow has one motion and the mind another. Even when pausing, even when weighing conclusions, the mind is moving forward, towards its goal.
