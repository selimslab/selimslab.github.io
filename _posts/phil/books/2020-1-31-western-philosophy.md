**Montaigne** Beauty in a simple life. A virtuous ordinary life is enough 

**Spinoza** People like religion for community, music, rituals, architecture, tradition, a sense of belonging, hope, fear 

**Schopenhauer**  Will to life, Even a blind mole does anything to live. Love is a mechanism to produce balanced children. A good life is to spend as much time with art and philosophy 

**Hegel** Progress is not linear. There is wisdom in every stage. Learn from ideas you dislike 

Art helps important ideas stick 

We need institutions to make ideas powerful 

**Nietzsche** Bitterness is hidden envy. Pleasure and pain comes together 

**Heidegger** Modern world is distracting us from nature. We are thrown into the world. We forget to be free and live for ourselves. All being is connected. Spend more time in graveyards

**Sartre** Things are weirder than we think. We are freer than we think 

**Camus** There are causes worth dying for, but none worth killing for. Enjoy the moment

**Adam Smith** The rich accumulate money because they need to be liked and approved

**Marx** Alienation, Commodity fetishism 

**Tolstoy** Ask that do I actually see? Literature is a tool of reform. Take pleasure in simple things

**Jane Austen** We should judge people more carefully. Replace material lens with moral lens. Dont be snobbish. Let your lover educate you.
