"I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree."

The best lack all conviction, 
while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.

Have much and be confused”

“When the greatness of Tao is present

action arises from one’s own heart

When the greatness of Tao is absent

action comes from the rules

of “kindness” and “justice”

If you need rules to be kind and just,

if you act virtuous,

this is a sure sign that virtue is absent

Thus we see the great hypocrisy”

Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu

A Silly Poem : 

Said Hamlet to Ophelia, 

I'll draw a sketch of thee, 

What kind of pencil shall I use? 

2B or not 2B?

All that is gold does not glitter,

Not all those who wander are lost;

The old that is strong does not wither,

Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

It’s dark because you are trying too hard.

Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly.

Yes, feel lightly even though you’re feeling deeply.

Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them.

Beautiful is the moment,

When the heart indifferent

To joy or sorrow, just trusts

Whatever this life brings

But finds time to just be.

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
