Promise Yourself<br/><br/>To be so strong that nothing<br/>can disturb your peace of mind.<br/>To talk health, happiness, and prosperity<br/>to every person you meet.<br/><br/>To make all your friends feel<br/>that there is something in them<br/>To look at the sunny side of everything<br/>and make your optimism come true.<br/><br/>To think only the best, to work only for the best,<br/>and to expect only the best.<br/>To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others<br/>as you are about your own.<br/><br/>To forget the mistakes of the past<br/>and press on to the greater achievements of the future.<br/>To wear a cheerful countenance at all times<br/>and give every living creature you meet a smile.<br/><br/>To give so much time to the improvement of yourself<br/>that you have no time to criticize others.<br/>To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,<br/>and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.<br/><br/>To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world,<br/>not in loud words but great deeds.<br/>To live in faith that the whole world is on your side<br/>so long as you are true to the best that is in you.

Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it.

What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it.

The unexamined life is not worth living.

When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead.

Suit up!

Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today

Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter

Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of others—that is too high a price to pay.

Despise The Free Lunch

The longer one hesitates before the door, the more estranged one becomes.

The world is my country, science is my religion.

Smile, because it confuses people. Smile, because it's easier than explaining what is killing you inside.

As you know, madness is like gravity...all it takes is a little push.

Nobody panics when things go “according to plan”. Even if the plan is horrifying!

If you’re good at something, never do it for free.

Why so serious? >:)

And...here...we...go...

Their morals, their code; it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see- I'll show you. When the chips are down these, uh, civilized people? They'll eat each other. See I'm not a monster, I'm just ahead of the curve.

‎"Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos...

Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben. (What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.) Not only our experiences, but all we have done, whatever great thoughts we may have had and all we have suffered, all this is not lost, though it is past; we have brought it into being. Having been is a kind of being, and perhaps the surest kind.

Insanity is doing the same thing, over and over again, but expecting different results.

Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.

Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.

It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety.

Now any dogma, based primarily on faith and emotionalism, is a dangerous weapon to use on others, since it is almost impossible to guarantee that the weapon will never be turned on the user.

I wanted to be a psychological engineer, but we lacked the facilities, so I did the next best thing - I went into politics. It's practically the same thing.

Scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty.

Any fool can tell a crisis when it arrives. The real service to the state is to detect it in embryo.

It has been my philosophy of life that difficulties vanish when faced boldly.

Past glories are poor feeding.

The Three Theorems of Psychohistorical Quantitivity:<br/><br/>The population under scrutiny is oblivious to the existence of the science of Psychohistory.<br/>The time periods dealt with are in the region of 3 generations.<br/>The population must be in the billions (±75 billions) for a statistical probability to have a psychohistorical validity.

A horse having a wolf as a powerful and dangerous enemy lived in constant fear of his life. Being driven to desperation, it occurred to him to seek a strong ally. Whereupon he approached a man, and offered an alliance, pointing out that the wolf was likewise an enemy of the man. The man accepted the partnership at once and offered to kill the wolf immediately, if his new partner would only co-operate by placing his greater speed at the man’s disposal. The horse was willing, and allowed the man to place bridle and saddle upon him. The man mounted, hunted down the wolf, and killed him. “The horse, joyful and relieved, thanked the man, and said: ‘Now that our enemy is dead, remove your bridle and saddle and restore my freedom.’ “Whereupon the man laughed loudly and replied, ‘Never!’ and applied the spurs with a will.

If you're born in a cubicle and grow up in a corridor, and work in a cell, and vacation in a crowded sun-room, then coming up into the open with nothing but sky over you might just give you a nervous breakdown.

Society is much more easily soothed than one's own conscience.

Plain question and plain answer make the shortest road out of most perplexities.

Be yourself. Don't worry about what other people are thinking of you, because they're probably feeling the same kind of scared, horrible feelings that everyone does.

The moral of the story is even though that seemed like the end of the world back then, right now I can look back on it and laugh. And if anyone is going through something similar right now just know it will get better.

Live in the moment... but don't be led by the moment, or the people who belong to it.

One of my rules is never to look sideways at what other people are doing but instead, do what I feel is right.

Just remember that this relationship is based on mutual trust and respect, so never reveal your true self.

You have to be a responsible adult and support yourself because no one else is going to do it for you.

Be the girl you want your daughter to be. Be the girl you want your son to date. Be classy, be smart, be real, but most importantly be nice.

Be the change that you wish to see in the world.

Without music, life would be a mistake.

A day without  laughter is a day wasted.

Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something.

Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.

You do not write your life with words...You write it with actions.  What you think is not important.  It is only important what you <i>do</i>.

Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.

Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.

You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.

Women and cats will do as they please, and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it may be necessary from time to time to give a stupid or misinformed beholder a black eye.

Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead.

Reality continues to ruin my life.

Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.

In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.

You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,<br/>Love like you'll never be hurt,<br/>Sing like there's nobody listening,<br/>And live like it's heaven on earth.

There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.

It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.

Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.

Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.

Everything you can imagine is real.

Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple.

Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.

Who are you to judge the life I live?<br/>I know I'm not perfect<br/>-and I don't live to be-<br/>but before you start pointing fingers...<br/>make sure you hands are clean!

Things change. And friends leave. Life doesn't stop for anybody.

He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much;<br/>Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;<br/>Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;<br/>Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it;<br/>Who has left the world better than he found it,<br/>Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;<br/>Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;<br/>Whose life was an inspiration;<br/>Whose memory a benediction.

When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable.

<b><i>The Paradoxical Commandments</i></b><br/><br/>People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered.<br/>Love them anyway.<br/><br/>If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.<br/>Do good anyway.<br/><br/>If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.<br/>Succeed anyway.<br/><br/>The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.<br/>Do good anyway.<br/><br/>Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.<br/>Be honest and frank anyway.<br/><br/>The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds.<br/>Think big anyway.<br/><br/>People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.<br/>Fight for a few underdogs anyway.<br/><br/>What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.<br/>Build anyway.<br/><br/>People really need help but may attack you if you do help them.<br/>Help people anyway.<br/><br/>Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth.<br/>Give the world the best you have anyway.

For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness.

Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.

Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.

You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.

There's nothing like deep breaths after laughing that hard. Nothing in the world like a sore stomach for the right reasons.

Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad.

They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.

You cannot protect yourself from sadness without protecting yourself from happiness.

It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.

No medicine cures what happiness cannot.

You can't be happy unless you're unhappy sometimes".

Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.

There comes a time when the world gets quiet and the only thing left is your own heart. So you'd better learn the sound of it. Otherwise you'll never understand what it's saying.

Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.

Don't waste your time with explanations: people only hear what they want to hear.

Don't spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door. 

A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.

Unfortunately, the clock is ticking, the hours are going by. The past increases, the future recedes. Possibilities decreasing, regrets mounting.

Time is an illusion.

Time is a created thing. To say 'I don't have time,' is like saying, 'I don't want to.

Those who make the worst use of their time are the first to complain of its brevity.

Don’t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.

Time doesn’t heal emotional pain, you need to learn how to let go.

It's being here now that's important. There's no past and there's no future. Time is a very misleading thing. All there is ever, is the now. We can gain experience from the past, but we can't relive it; and we can hope for the future, but we don't know if there is one.

No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.

Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.

We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.

I've never fooled anyone. I've let people fool themselves. They didn't bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn't argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn't.

Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently.

Attitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Optimism is a choice. Kindness is a choice. Giving is a choice. Respect is a choice. Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.

We are addicted to our thoughts. We cannot change anything if we cannot change our thinking.

People tend to complicate their own lives, as if living weren't already complicated enough.

Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them.

Take responsibility of your own happiness, never put it in other people’s hands.

Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.

Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value.

It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.

Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.

If A is a success in life, then A equals x plus y plus z. Work is x; y is play; and z is keeping your mouth shut

I'm a success today because I had a friend who believed in me and I didn't have the heart to let him down.

The Road Not Taken<br/><br/>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>And sorry I could not travel both	<br/>And be one traveler, long I stood	<br/>And looked down one as far as I could	<br/>To where it bent in the undergrowth;	        <br/> <br/>Then took the other, as just as fair,	<br/>And having perhaps the better claim,	<br/>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;	<br/>Though as for that the passing there	<br/>Had worn them really about the same,	        <br/> <br/>And both that morning equally lay	<br/>In leaves no step had trodden black.	<br/>Oh, I kept the first for another day!	<br/>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,	<br/>I doubted if I should ever come back.	        <br/> <br/>I shall be telling this with a sigh	<br/>Somewhere ages and ages hence:	<br/>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—	<br/>I took the one less traveled by,	<br/>And that has made all the difference.

We love the things we love for what they are.

Tell me, what is it you plan to do <br/>with your one wild and precious life?

Unbeing dead isn't being alive.

One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable words.

Still round the corner there may wait<br/> A new road or a secret gate<br/>And though I oft have passed them by<br/> A day will come at last when I<br/>Shall take the hidden paths that run<br/> West of the Moon, East of the Sun.

I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; <br/>I lift my eyes and all is born again.

Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be.

There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of life. <br/>" Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget, that until the day God will deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is contained in these two words, 'Wait and Hope.

Life's under no obligation to give us what we expect.

But I know, somehow, that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.

Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed.

The things you do for yourself are gone when you are gone, but the things you do for others remain as your legacy.

The very least you can do in your life is figure out what you hope for. And the most you can do is live inside that hope. Not admire it from a distance but live right in it, under its roof.

You can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep Spring from coming.

It is better to remain silent at the risk of being thought a fool, than to talk and remove all doubt of it.

There are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation, where they work long, hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like.

Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity

Like all magnificent things, it's very simple.

I just did some calculations and I've been able to determine that you're full of shit.

One of the deep secrets of life is that all that is really worth the doing is what we do for others.

What are men to rocks and mountains?

Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.<br/><br/>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.  Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.  Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.<br/><br/>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.<br/><br/>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet.  Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.<br/><br/>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

I, myself, am made entirely of flaws, stitched together with good intentions.

Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all.  Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild.  So you let them go, or when you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you.

What is hell? I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love.

Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.

My life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean. Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?

The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider Freeways, but narrower viewpoints.  We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time.  We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.<br/><br/>We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.  We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values.  We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.<br/><br/>We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years.  We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor.  We conquered outer space but not inner space.  We've done larger things, but not better things.<br/><br/>We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice.  We write more, but learn less.  We plan more, but accomplish less.  We've learned to rush, but not to wait.  We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.<br/><br/>These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.<br/><br/>These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes.  These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill.  It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom.  A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete...<br/><br/>Remember, to spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever.  Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.<br/><br/>Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.<br/><br/>Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it.  A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.<br/><br/>Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person might not be there again.  Give time to love, give time to speak! And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.

The scariest moment is always just before you start.

The more I see, the less I know for sure.

Dare to Be<br/><br/>When a new day begins, dare to smile gratefully.<br/><br/>When there is darkness, dare to be the first to shine a light.<br/><br/>When there is injustice, dare to be the first to condemn it.<br/><br/>When something seems difficult, dare to do it anyway.<br/><br/>When life seems to beat you down, dare to fight back.<br/><br/>When there seems to be no hope, dare to find some.<br/><br/>When you’re feeling tired, dare to keep going.<br/><br/>When times are tough, dare to be tougher.<br/><br/>When love hurts you, dare to love again.<br/><br/>When someone is hurting, dare to help them heal.<br/><br/>When another is lost, dare to help them find the way.<br/><br/>When a friend falls, dare to be the first to extend a hand.<br/><br/>When you cross paths with another, dare to make them smile.<br/><br/>When you feel great, dare to help someone else feel great too.<br/><br/>When the day has ended, dare to feel as you’ve done your best.<br/><br/>Dare to be the best you can –<br/><br/>At all times, Dare to be!

there is a loneliness in this world so great<br/>that you can see it in the slow movement of<br/>the hands of a clock.<br/><br/>people so tired<br/>mutilated<br/>either by love or no love.<br/><br/>people just are not good to each other<br/>one on one.<br/><br/>the rich are not good to the rich<br/>the poor are not good to the poor.<br/><br/>we are afraid.<br/><br/>our educational system tells us<br/>that we can all be<br/>big-ass winners.<br/><br/>it hasn't told us<br/>about the gutters<br/>or the suicides.<br/><br/>or the terror of one person<br/>aching in one place<br/>alone<br/><br/>untouched<br/>unspoken to<br/><br/>watering a plant.

The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are. You trade in your reality for a role. You trade in your sense for an act. You give up your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask. There can't be any large-scale revolution until there's a personal revolution, on an individual level. It's got to happen inside first.

Sometimes people don't want to hear the truth because they don't want their illusions destroyed.

Do you think I am an automaton? — a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you — and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal — as we are!

Reading one book is like eating one potato chip.

The truth is, unless you let go, unless you forgive yourself, unless you forgive the situation, unless you realize that the situation is over, you cannot move forward.

The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.

You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.

Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming "Wow! What a Ride!

That's the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink. If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.

Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace.

Tell the truth, or someone will tell it for you.

Who said nights were for sleep?

It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.

Why do you go away?  So that you can come back.  So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors.  And the people there see you differently, too.  Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.

Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.

None but ourselves can free our minds.

You probably wouldn’t worry about what people think of you if you could know how seldom they do.

Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.

Nobody can hurt me without my permission.

By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.

The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart

What happens when people open their hearts?"<br/>"They get better.

If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need.

Love is a fire. But whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house, you can never tell.

No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally – and often far more – worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.

Resist much, obey little.

She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it).

Never be afraid to raise your voice for honesty and truth and compassion against injustice and lying and greed. If people all over the world...would do this, it would change the earth.

And, in the end<br/>The love you take<br/>is equal to the love you make.

The simple things are also the most extraordinary things, and only the wise can see them.

Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen.

You have to die a few times before you can really<br/>live.

Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.

To be nobody but <br/>yourself in a world <br/>which is doing its best day and night to make you like <br/>everybody else means to fight the hardest battle <br/>which any human being can fight and never stop fighting.

When a man gives his opinion, he's a man. When a woman gives her opinion, she's a bitch.

You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.

All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.

Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new.

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you.

I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.

Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.

I love people who make me laugh. I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person.

Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I've ever known.

If you are going through hell, keep going.

Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.

Some people feel the rain. Others just get wet.

War is peace. <br/>Freedom is slavery. <br/>Ignorance is strength.

But I don’t want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.<br/>"Oh, you can’t help that," said the Cat: "we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad."<br/>"How do you know I’m mad?" said Alice.<br/>"You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn’t have come here.

I lie to myself all the time. But I never believe me.

Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.

My ambition is handicapped by laziness

Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.

The important thing is not to stop questioning.  Curiosity has its own reason for existence.  One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality.  It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.<br/><br/>—"Old Man's Advice to Youth: 'Never Lose a Holy Curiosity.'" <i>LIFE Magazine</i> (2 May 1955) p. 64

People are afraid of themselves, of their own reality; their feelings most of all. People talk about how great love is, but that’s bullshit. Love hurts. Feelings are disturbing. People are taught that pain is evil and dangerous. How can they deal with love if they’re afraid to feel? Pain is meant to wake us up. People try to hide their pain. But they’re wrong. Pain is something to carry, like a radio. You feel your strength in the experience of pain. It’s all in how you carry it. That’s what matters. Pain is a feeling. Your feelings are a part of you. Your own reality. If you feel ashamed of them, and hide them, you’re letting society destroy your reality. You should stand up for your right to feel your pain.

But who prays for Satan? Who, in eighteen centuries, has had the common humanity to pray for the one sinner that needed it most?

No tears in the writer, no tears in the reader.  No surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader.

When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.

Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.

Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened.

I wonder how many people I've looked at all my life and never seen.

There are worse crimes than burning books.  One of them is not reading them.

We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.

Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.

If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.

There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.

Hell is empty and all the devils are here.

You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' You must do the thing you think you cannot do.

I can be changed by what happens to me.  But I refuse to be reduced by it.<br/><br/>(Popular misquote of "You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.")

My experience of life is that it is not divided up into genres; it’s a horrifying, romantic, tragic, comical, science-fiction cowboy detective novel. You know, with a bit of pornography if you're lucky.

Here's all you have to know about men and women: women are crazy, men are stupid. And the main reason women are crazy is that men are stupid.

The best index to a person's character is how he treats people who can't do him any good, and how he treats people who can't fight back.

The most important thing is to enjoy your life—to be happy—it's all that matters.

Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one’s definition of your life; define yourself.

It is hard enough to remember my opinions, without also remembering my reasons for them!

Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes.

The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. <br/><br/>There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.

It is so hard to leave—until you leave. And then it is the easiest goddamned thing in the world.

Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see.

Monsters are real, and ghosts are real too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win.

Libraries were full of ideas—perhaps the most dangerous and powerful of all weapons.

Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right.

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.

Think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy.

The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven..

I am not young enough to know everything.

If a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?

Always do what you are afraid to do.

One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple.

Make it a rule never to give a child a book you would not read yourself.

Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens.

One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it.  Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away.

Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.

Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, 'It might have been.

A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.

I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.<br/>- Atticus Finch

When his life was ruined, his family killed, his farm destroyed, Job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens, "Why god? Why me?" and the thundering voice of God answered, There's just something about you that pisses me off.

Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.

In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.

When I have a little money, I buy books; and if I have any left, I buy food and clothes.

Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.

I like work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.

Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, I'm not going to make it, but you laugh inside — remembering all the times you've felt that way.

Sarcasm is the last refuge of the imaginatively bankrupt.

The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.

The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.

Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.

Isn't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?

Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something.

Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.

It's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals, because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep them, because in spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.

You educate a man; you educate a man. You educate a woman; you educate a generation.

When someone shows you who they are believe them; the first time.

All the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust.

To love. To be loved. To never forget your own insignificance. To never get used to the unspeakable violence and the vulgar disparity of life around you. To seek joy in the saddest places. To pursue beauty to its lair. To never simplify what is complicated or complicate what is simple. To respect strength, never power. Above all, to watch. To try and understand. To never look away. And never, never to forget.

How lucky I am to have known somebody and something that saying goodbye to is so damned awful.

You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese, the Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the U.S. of arrogance, Germany doesn't want to go to war, and the three most powerful men in America are named "Bush", "Dick", and "Colin." Need I say more?

Chance is perhaps the pseudonym of God when he does not want to sign.

There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life.

Don't touch any of my weapons without my permission."<br/>"Well, there goes my plan for selling them all on eBay," Clary muttered.<br/>"Selling them on what?"<br/>Clary smiled blandly at him. "A mythical place of great magical power.

In a good bookroom you feel in some mysterious way that you are absorbing the wisdom contained in all the books through your skin, without even opening them.

Do not read, as children do, to amuse yourself, or like the ambitious, for the purpose of instruction. No, read in order to live.

Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.

Don't think or judge, just listen.

What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.

The soul is healed by being with children.

I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.

Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!

If you were half as funny as you think you are, you'd be twice as funny as you really are.

The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.

Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.

How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.

It's far better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone — so far.

And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.

If you don't know where you're going, any road'll take you there

When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares.

An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.

If you're gonna be two-faced at least make one of them pretty.

Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.

Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.

Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent

Tis better to have loved and lost<br/>Than never to have loved at all.

I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited.

It's so hard to forget pain, but it's even harder to remember sweetness.  We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace.

What you're supposed to do when you don't like a thing is change it. If you can't change it, change the way you think about it. Don't complain.

Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.

He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you.

Just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have.

Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it.

To die will be an awfully big adventure.

We believe in ordinary acts of bravery, in the courage that drives one person to stand up for another.

You have to write the book that wants to be written. And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups, then you write it for children.

The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.

Piglet sidled up to Pooh from behind. <br/>"Pooh!" he whispered.<br/>"Yes, Piglet?"<br/>"Nothing," said Piglet, taking Pooh's paw. "I just wanted to be sure of you.

Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.

When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.

It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.

The difference between genius and stupidity is: genius has its limits.

Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.

You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.

Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.

Do one thing every day that scares you.

Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.

The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.

It is what you read when you don't have to that determines what you will be when you can't help it.

The real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or smiling into your eyes or just staring into space.

It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default.

Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?

Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You.

To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.

If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again, there is no use in reading it at all.

Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere.

The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,<br/>And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.

Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.

Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.

You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go...

That which does not kill us makes us stronger.

A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one.

It is never too late to be what you might have been.

It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.

If you judge people, you have no time to love them.

My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.

I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you.

I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.

We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.

If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.

Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.

You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.

Design is really an act of communication, which means having a deep understanding of the person with whom the designer is communicating.

Principles of design:<br/>1. Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head.<br/>2. Simplify the structure of tasks.<br/>3. Make things visible: bridge gulfs between Execution and Evaluation.<br/>4. Get the mappings right.<br/>5. Exploit the power of constraints.<br/>6. Design for error.<br/>7. When all else fails, standardize.

Rule of thumb: if you think something is clever and sophisticated beware-it is probably self-indulgence.

Learning should take place when it is needed, when the learner is interested, not according to some arbitrary, fixed schedule

Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible,

A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all: solve the correct problem.

Fail often, fail fast,

Any time you see signs or labels added to a device, it is an indication of bad design: a simple lock should not require instructions.

What makes something simple or complex? It's not the number of dials or controls or how many features it has: It is whether the person using the device has a good conceptual model of how it operates.

The vicious cycle starts: if you fail at something, you think it is your fault. Therefore you think you can’t do that task. As a result, next time you have to do the task, you believe you can’t, so you don’t even try. The result is that you can’t, just as you thought.

When things go right, people credit their own abilities and intelligence. The onlookers do the reverse. When they see things go well for someone else, they sometimes credit the environment, or luck.

It is easy to design devices that work well when everything goes as planned. The hard and necessary part of design is to make things work well even when things do not go as planned.

A story tells of Henry Ford’s buying scrapped Ford cars and having his engineers disassemble them to see which parts failed and which were still in good shape. Engineers assumed this was done to find the weak parts and make them stronger. Nope. Ford explained that he wanted to find the parts that were still in good shape. The company could save money if they redesigned these parts to fail at the same time as the others.

We must design for the way people behave,<br/>not for how we would wish them to behave.

original ideas are the easy part. Actually producing the idea as a successful product is what is hard.

In design, one of the most difficult activities is to get the specifications right:
