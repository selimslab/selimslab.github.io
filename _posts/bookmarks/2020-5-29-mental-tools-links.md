[Don’t Pay for 95%](https://5kids1condo.com/dont-pay-for-95/)

we are not using everything we buy all the time. We spend a lot of time an effort to save enough to buy something, and continuous effort to maintain it. 

Renting looks expensive because we only see the short term price. We see the rental cost of 2 weeks, not the money, time, and energy not spent in other 50 weeks.

In short, don’t pay for the 95% you won’t use.
