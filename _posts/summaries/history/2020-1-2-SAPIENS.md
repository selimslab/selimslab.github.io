gods, nations, money, human rights, laws, justice.. are all human imagination. 

luxuries tend to become necessities and create obligations.

people accumulated more things, which tied them down 

foragers had less anxiety. no sense in worrying about a thing you can't influence.

people invented gods, companies, nations to provide necessary social links

there is no justice in history 

people usually follow the bad guys 

pain is inevitable, suffering is optional 

feel things as they are 

don't crave 

no craving = no suffering 

train the mind to experience reality as it is 

america vespucci had the courage to say "I don't know"

self fulfilling expectations

profits must be reinvested 

to build trust -> pay your debts, protect property and freedoms 

credit rating is far more important than natural resources -> switzerland vs afgh. 

the most important economic resource is trust in the future 


money brings happiness up to a point -> maybe 100k a year 

wanna be rich -> invest 

wanna be poor -> consume 

happiness = reality vs expectations

happiness levels are set biochemically 

stop craving, stop pursuing, live in the present 

pursit -> misery
