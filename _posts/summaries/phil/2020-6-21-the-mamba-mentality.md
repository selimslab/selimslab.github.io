The mentality includes

* to respect your craft 
* aiming to be the best 
* doing the hard work to be the as best as you can
* learning from your mistakes 
* learning from others mistakes
* picking up the best ideas and techniques of others and to include them in your game 
* meeting a challenge head on, not backing off
* not to despair, to be hopeful and fight back 
* to be a good human being beyond being successful at your craft
