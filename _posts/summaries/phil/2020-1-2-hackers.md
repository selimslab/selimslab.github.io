the secret of success is looking from other's perpectives

in the aggregate unseen details become visible 

save some easy tasks 

understand what you are doing 

divide projects into modules with definite owners

what you can't say? if nothing, is it a coincidence?

people get mad when they believe it might be true

start asking, could this be true?

question assumptions

what groups are powerful but nervous?

draw a sharp line between your thoughts and your speech.

pensieri stretti, viso sciolto

Mark of strength is not to take yourself too seriously

reliability = paying attention 

an open face and closed thoughts

watch your own thoughts from a distance
