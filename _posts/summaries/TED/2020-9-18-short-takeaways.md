For cognitive tasks, reward hinders, carrots don’t work

## Stress

Comfort leads to complacency

Moderate levels of acute stress helps to grow 

Pre-mortem 

Organize 

A dress rehearsal for unexpected things 

Ask what could go wrong 


## Psycopath test

## Forecasting

Bill gates warned against a global epidemic 5 years ago 

Forecasting thing to a degree is possible when there is evidence and thought, like istanbul earthquake 


## Compulsive lying 

Why lie ? Because it is easier than making something better in reality 

When you accept yourself, when you accept your flaws, when you have courage to be vulnerable, the urge to lie will disappear 

## Impostors

No need to feel like an impostor. 

“If you feel exhausted, it’s not necessarily because there’s something wrong with you. Maybe you’re just running fast.”

Try instead to be patient, and flexible. Work hard. And above all, enjoy it.

stay curious, let your love of something pull you, but do not hastily give all of yourself and find there is nothing left to give. Don’t engage in the achievement rat race. Listen to praise from those you respect, but ignore it from those you don’t. Push back when society eggs you on. Focus on things that matter the most to you alone. Ignore fears of being an imposter — be authentic to yourself, that is enough. Keep your hands on the brakes. Enjoy your freedom of time and mind.
