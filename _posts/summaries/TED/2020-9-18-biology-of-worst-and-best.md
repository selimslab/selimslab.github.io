We don’t hate violence, we love it in the right context 

Pulling a trigger or touching someone has very different meanings in different contexts

Multiple levels of causality 

An example case:

There is man running toward you and holds something that looks like a gun. You shot him 

1 sec before: amygdala -> fear, excitement 

minutes: a large black male is more likely to be shot, or if you are hungry or tired, frontal cortex doesn’t work well and ask you that are you sure if it is a gun  

Hours to days -> testesteron, stress hormones, alcohol -> they are not the cause but they amplify existing tendencies 

Weeks to months -> neuroplasticity -> brain changes by experience, if previous months were stressful, amygdala will enlarge, and will be harder to control 

Years to decades -> adolescence shapes the brain , stress in childhood or as a fetus leads to larger amygdala and elevated stress hormone levels

Genes don’t determine anything because they work differently in different environments. Genes and environment interact 

Centuries -> if ancestors are nomadic herders, mood are that they will have a culture of honor and quick to anger and revenge, and this values can stick around for centuries 

Millions of years -> evolution, some species have lower aggression levels some higher 

—

if you wanna understand a behavior, there are factors from the second before to millions of years before 

Its complicated and be careful to conclude what causes a behavior, especially if it’s a one you are judging harshly 

The single most important having to do with change, every bits of biology can change and it is possible to change in a good way 

Ecosystems change -> Sahara was a lush grassland 

Cultures change -> Swedes 

Brains change -> people can get better even the ones who have done bad things 

We can change our worst sides, history is full of such examples and we are able to repeat this and change for the better
