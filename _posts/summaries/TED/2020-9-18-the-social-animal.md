* we are social animals (groups are smarter than individuals, effectiveness is determined by communication)
* emotion is the foundation of reason, without it we can’t make decisions
* we are all overconfident (19% think they’re in the top 1% of earners, 95% of professors think they’re better than average)
* we need the mental models and humility to realize we aren’t great
