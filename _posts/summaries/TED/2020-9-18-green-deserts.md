Livestock

Bare soil cannot hold carbon and water 

4 months rain, 8 months dry, if the grass is not gone before the next rain, its very bad 

Burning grass leaves the soil bare, not good 

Livestock is the key 

Grazing animals prevents desertification 

2/3s of the world turning to deserts 

If we reverse the desertification for half the worlds grasslands, we will be back to preindustrial levels
