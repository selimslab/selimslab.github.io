## Pain
What determines your success isn’t “What do you want to enjoy?”
 The question is, “What pain do you want to sustain?” 

## Productivity
Finally, to repeat one more time: productivity in the wrong direction isn’t worth anything at all.  Think more about what to work on.


## Be Kind
 Being kind isn’t the same as being nice. It isn’t about superficial praise. 
It doesn’t mean dulling your opinions. And it shouldn’t diminish the passion 
with which you present them.

Being kind is fundamentally about taking responsibility for your impact on 
the people around you. It requires you be mindful of their feelings and 
considerate of the way your presence affects them.

## Offline
If you’re serious about making an impact in the world, power down your smartphone, close your browser tabs, roll up your sleeves and get to work.

## Design and Society

In the current age of global wars, international terrorism, financial turmoil, outsourced labor, awakening behemoths (China), increasing corruption, people fear the future.
Look at Apple, classic 1960's space age retro.
Look at Instagram. Cozy and nostalgic polaroid filters.
If I designed for the future, I'd take hints from the past.
A key difference is that in the past, different social groups had something to look forward to (emancipation and liberation), despite the looming threat of thermonuclear warfare. Nowadays? In the western hemisphere? It's all gloom and doom.
In western markets - Your brand should function as an opiate, it should reassure and placate people.
In emerging markets - Sell the American dream of old.
Of course there's a third way, show us a way out of here. But for that advertisement alone is not enough. You'd have to change how your business runs and make a lasting impact on society. Forget shareholder value and start thinking about society.

## Values

Care

Grow 

Aim higher
 
Start small and iterate


## Human brain is single threaded
“It's a good idea to save some easy tasks for moments when you would otherwise stall.”

## Disagree
It's perfectly OK to disagree with someone; but please consider doing so in a respectful and thoughtful tone. Remember that others often shut-down when they read criticism, even when well warranted. The way you phrase and present yourself defines whether you're giving criticism or critique.
