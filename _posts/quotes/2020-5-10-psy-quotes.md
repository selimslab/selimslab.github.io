### happiness 

Happiness is only real when shared

The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.

Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.

Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them.

But who can say what's best? That's why you need to grab whatever chance you have of happiness where you find it, and not worry about other people too much.

## people 

Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.

If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.
 
Let no man pull you so low as to hate him.

In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule.


Respect other people's feelings. It might mean nothing to you, but it could mean everything to them.

Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.

Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, "It might have been.

I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think

I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.


People change and forget to tell each other.

Don't waste your time with explanations: people only hear what they want to hear.

Just ignore everything they say and only pay attention to what they do.
