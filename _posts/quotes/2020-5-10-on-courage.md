## courage


Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free.

Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear - not absence of fear.

The only real prison is fear, and the only real freedom is freedom from fear

I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.

Now that she had nothing to lose, she was free. -> so is death the ultimate freedom?
