title: The Mamba Mentality of Kobe 

---

It's a mentality of growth, courage, respect, discipline, and hard work 

* Respecting yourself, and your craft. 
* Aiming to be the best and doing the hard work to be the as best as you can. 
* Learning from mistakes and successes of others, picking up the best ideas and techniques and including them in your game. 
* Meeting a challenge head on, not backing off
* Not to despair, to be hopeful and fight back 
* To be a good human being beyond being successful at your craft
