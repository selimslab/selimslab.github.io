    "..The dawn mist glowing \n The water flowing \n The endless river \n Forever and ever",
  "There must be some kind of way outta here, \n Said the joker to the thief",
  "And you better start swimmin' \n Or you'll sink like a stone \n For the times they are a-changin'",
  "..With all memory and fate, \n Driven deep beneath the waves",
  "I see my red door and I want it painted black",
  "All along the watchtower, princes kept a view",
  "Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes",
  "Let's take the backstreet",
  "..silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins",
  "..Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow",
  "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans",
  "All that is gold does not glitter, \n Not all those who wander are lost",
  "California dreamin' \n On such a winter's day",
  "Everybody gotta learn sometime",
  "..Be a simple man, be something you love and understand",
  "Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think",
  "I look at the world \n And I notice it's turning \n While my guitar gently weeps",
  "Living is easy with eyes closed \n Misunderstanding all you see",
  "All in all it's just another brick in the wall",
  "How many seas must a white dove sail \n Before she sleeps on the sand?",
  "How many roads must a man walk down \n Before you call him a man?",
  "I don't need no arms around me \n And I don't need no drugs to calm me",
  "The line it is drawn \n The curse it is cast \n The slow one now \n Will later be fast \n As the present now \n Will later be past \n The order is rapidly fadin'",
  "Take a sad song and make it better",
  "Lay your weary head to rest",
  "With every mistake, \n We must surely be learning \n Still my guitar gently weeps",
  "Nothing really matters, Anyone can see",
  "And the first one now \n Will later be last \n For the times they are a-changin'",
  "Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?",
  "The more I see, the less I know, the more I like to let it go",
  "The hour's getting late",
  "I wandered lonely as a cloud",
  "Do not go gentle into that good night. \n Rage, rage against the dying of the light",
  "For the loser now \n Will be later to win \n For the times they are a-changin'",
  "Oh well, whatever, never mind",
  "In the white room with black curtains \n Near the station",
  "And if you listen very hard \n The tune will come to you at last"
