irrevocable judgement

avoid being hated by all 

let no one can hope to deceive you

leave dirty work to others
keep graceful work at your hand

 show greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude
avoid showing fickle, mean, irresolute 

virtue can be your ruin, vice can be a virtue 

follow the spirit of times
